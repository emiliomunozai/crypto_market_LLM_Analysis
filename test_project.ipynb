      "\n",
      "Content:\n",
      " The lightning network is still under development but that hasn't stopped the Bitfury Group from launching a new product suite designed to make the system easier for merchants and consumers to use.\n",
      "Wallets, eCommerce Software, Terminals and Nodes\n",
      "Lightning network has been hailed as the savior of Bitcoin, bringing its transaction speeds to equal or exceed some of the alternative cryptocurrencies that have emerged over the past couple of years. Rapid and low cost transactions would no doubt to wonders for Bitcoin adoption in everyday life but so far progress has been slow.\n",
      "Blockchain technology provider Bitfury, founded in 2011, aims to change that with its new LN based products which include an open source LN Bitcoin wallet, a hardware terminal and e-commerce software for vendors, payment processors, and a suite of developer tools. A public Lightning Network node has also been created to help users open payment channels.\n",
      "According to the announcement the products, which are supported by Bitfury's Lightning Network engineering and research team, Lightning Peach, have been designed to bring all steps of the business cycle onto the network. Ease of onboarding is key to overall adoption and Bitfury have acknowledged this with the new suite for both merchants and consumers. Bitfury CEO, Valery Vavilov, added;\n",
      "'The Lightning Network will enable people to use bitcoin in their everyday lives. By providing these products to the market, Bitfury is encouraging worldwide adoption of this technology and providing unparalleled support to consumers and merchants.'\n",
      "There are a raft of features on the new Peach wallet which all make using LN for daily transactions far easier. The commerce suite has been targeted at individual merchants and payment processing companies, again making their lives easier when dealing with LN. The terminal provides point of sale and vending machine support for instant, low cost Bitcoin payments.\n",
      "Bitfury is not the only company eager to get more people using lightning network. In a related report, Forbes has suggested that LN could replace all potentially unsecure altcoins offering faster transactions. Online retailer, Bitrefill, has claimed that almost twice the amount of payments made are processed on LN than all other altcoins combined.\n",
      "The company offers a range of digital goodies such as gift cards and prepaid phone minutes via cryptocurrency payments. Just like Bitfury, it too has been working on a range of products to increase usage and adoption of the lightning network. Referring to Thor, a channel creation service on Bitrefill's node, the company blog added; 'If someone's looking to receive bitcoin, as tips or other earnings, this is a quick and easy tool to get started. Bitrefill's node is a highly interconnected in the Lightning network,'\n",
      "Adoption is paramount to the growth and success of cryptocurrencies, and for Bitcoin at least, the lightning network plays a huge role in increasing its daily usage as a means of quick and easy payment as it was originally designed.\n",

      " Bitcoin Value Dropping To Zero? Expert Predicts Fall Of Crypto\n",
      "\n",
      "Content:\n",
      " Jeff Schumacher, the founder of BCG Digital Ventures, has predictedÂ that the value of bitcoin could go as low as zero. As one of the top investors in the crypto arena, Schumacher said that bitcoinÂ couldÂ be at risk especially since there are still doubts over the actual value of the currency.Cryptocurrencies had a wild and challenging 2018. CoinMarketCap estimated that the market lost around $480 billion worth of value. This is after the industry accomplished a record high in 2017. The following yearÂ was a different story.Â Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, took a nosedive.On WednesdayÂ at around 1.15 a.m. London time,Â the cryptocurrency was trading at $3,571. And now Schumacher thinksÂ the value could dive deeper.'I do believe it will go to zero. I think it's a great technology but I don't believe it's a currency. It's not based on anything,' Schumacher, a well-known investor in the blockchainÂ sphere,Â said during a CNBC-hosted panel in Davos, Switzerland.Meanwhile,Â Glenn Hutchins, chairman of North Island, pointed out during the debate that the role of bitcoin in the future may be toÂ storeÂ value.'It might be that the role of bitcoin in the system could be to bring value back, to hold your value there while you have tokens that have other use cases that you aren't using at the moment,' Hutchins said. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, along with PartnerÂ Edith Yeung ofÂ 500 StartupsÂ and other panelists agreed with him. Their interest lies more on the underlyingÂ blockchain technology.'I am much less interested in investing around bitcoin as a currency unit or a currency equivalent, or even the blockchain as an accounting ledger. I am thinking much more about the protocols. In other words, what is the underlying protocol going to do as a consequence of which, which tokens are valuable or not,' Hutchins added.In other news, Lightning Network payments reportedly surpassed altcoins.Â Many consider the Lightning Network as bitcoin's response to the low transaction fees of altcoins. More importantly, the protocolÂ has been regarded as a potential avenue to showcase the best of both worlds. It can offer better payment liquidity and functionality. The recent milestone supports theories about the potential of Lightning Network to replace altcoins as a means for cheaperÂ transactions.\n",

      " Bitcoin Value Dropping To Zero? Expert Predicts Fall Of Crypto\n",
      "\n",
      "Content:\n",
      " Jeff Schumacher, the founder of BCG Digital Ventures, has predictedÂ that the value of bitcoin could go as low as zero. As one of the top investors in the crypto arena, Schumacher said that bitcoinÂ couldÂ be at risk especially since there are still doubts over the actual value of the currency.Cryptocurrencies had a wild and challenging 2018. CoinMarketCap estimated that the market lost around $480 billion worth of value. This is after the industry accomplished a record high in 2017. The following yearÂ was a different story.Â Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, took a nosedive.On WednesdayÂ at around 1.15 a.m. London time,Â the cryptocurrency was trading at $3,571. And now Schumacher thinksÂ the value could dive deeper.'I do believe it will go to zero. I think it's a great technology but I don't believe it's a currency. It's not based on anything,' Schumacher, a well-known investor in the blockchainÂ sphere,Â said during a CNBC-hosted panel in Davos, Switzerland.Meanwhile,Â Glenn Hutchins, chairman of North Island, pointed out during the debate that the role of bitcoin in the future may be toÂ storeÂ value.'It might be that the role of bitcoin in the system could be to bring value back, to hold your value there while you have tokens that have other use cases that you aren't using at the moment,' Hutchins said. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, along with PartnerÂ Edith Yeung ofÂ 500 StartupsÂ and other panelists agreed with him. Their interest lies more on the underlyingÂ blockchain technology.'I am much less interested in investing around bitcoin as a currency unit or a currency equivalent, or even the blockchain as an accounting ledger. I am thinking much more about the protocols. In other words, what is the underlying protocol going to do as a consequence of which, which tokens are valuable or not,' Hutchins added.In other news, Lightning Network payments reportedly surpassed altcoins.Â Many consider the Lightning Network as bitcoin's response to the low transaction fees of altcoins. More importantly, the protocolÂ has been regarded as a potential avenue to showcase the best of both worlds. It can offer better payment liquidity and functionality. The recent milestone supports theories about the potential of Lightning Network to replace altcoins as a means for cheaperÂ transactions.\n",

      " Bitcoin Value Dropping To Zero? Expert Predicts Fall Of Crypto\n",
      "\n",
      "Content:\n",
      " Jeff Schumacher, the founder of BCG Digital Ventures, has predictedÂ that the value of bitcoin could go as low as zero. As one of the top investors in the crypto arena, Schumacher said that bitcoinÂ couldÂ be at risk especially since there are still doubts over the actual value of the currency.Cryptocurrencies had a wild and challenging 2018. CoinMarketCap estimated that the market lost around $480 billion worth of value. This is after the industry accomplished a record high in 2017. The following yearÂ was a different story.Â Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization, took a nosedive.On WednesdayÂ at around 1.15 a.m. London time,Â the cryptocurrency was trading at $3,571. And now Schumacher thinksÂ the value could dive deeper.'I do believe it will go to zero. I think it's a great technology but I don't believe it's a currency. It's not based on anything,' Schumacher, a well-known investor in the blockchainÂ sphere,Â said during a CNBC-hosted panel in Davos, Switzerland.Meanwhile,Â Glenn Hutchins, chairman of North Island, pointed out during the debate that the role of bitcoin in the future may be toÂ storeÂ value.'It might be that the role of bitcoin in the system could be to bring value back, to hold your value there while you have tokens that have other use cases that you aren't using at the moment,' Hutchins said. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, along with PartnerÂ Edith Yeung ofÂ 500 StartupsÂ and other panelists agreed with him. Their interest lies more on the underlyingÂ blockchain technology.'I am much less interested in investing around bitcoin as a currency unit or a currency equivalent, or even the blockchain as an accounting ledger. I am thinking much more about the protocols. In other words, what is the underlying protocol going to do as a consequence of which, which tokens are valuable or not,' Hutchins added.In other news, Lightning Network payments reportedly surpassed altcoins.Â Many consider the Lightning Network as bitcoin's response to the low transaction fees of altcoins. More importantly, the protocolÂ has been regarded as a potential avenue to showcase the best of both worlds. It can offer better payment liquidity and functionality. The recent milestone supports theories about the potential of Lightning Network to replace altcoins as a means for cheaperÂ transactions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Content:\n",
      " Bitcoin has been struggling over the last 12 months due to sky-high expectations after its massive 2017 bull run that saw the bitcoin price leap from under $1,000 at the start of the year to almost $20,000.\n",
      "The bitcoin price has fallen steadily over the last 12 months, slipping to lows of near $3,000 as bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors fret over delays to network upgrades, lackluster institutional investment, and heavy-handed regulators. Now, in a surprising development, the on-going U.S. government shutdown has forced the withdrawalÂ of a closely-watched proposal to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Cboe BZX Exchangeâdealing a blow to those who'd hoped the long-awaited bitcoin ETF would bring a fresh round of investment into the stagnating market.Â \n",
      " The bitcoin and cryptocurrency market has lacked direction over the last few months, moving steadily... [+] lower as investors feel for a floor. Getty The bitcoin ETF proposal, broughtÂ by investment firm VanEck and financial services provider SolidX, has faced an uphillÂ battle forÂ approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to concerns the bitcoin price is susceptible to market manipulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to withdraw the application amid the U.S. government shutdown, announced in an SEC filing, saw the bitcoin price dip slightly though it remains around the $3,500 it's been trading at since early January.\n",
      "WithÂ many SEC staff furloughed because of the partial closure of the U.S. federal government and the regulator's deadline to decide on the application fast approaching, Cboe Global Markets decided to pull the VanEck and SolidX application with the view to reapply at a later date. \"The SEC is affected by the shutdownâ¦ we were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop. And so, instead of trying to slip through or something, we just had the application pulled and we will re-file and re-engage in the discussions when the SEC gets going again,\" Jan van Eck, the chief executive of VanEck,Â told CNBC.\n",
      " The bitcoin price has been on a steady downward trend for the last 12 months. CoinDesk \n",
      "The SEC had set a deadline of February 27 to decide on the bitcoin ETF proposal after repeated delays and calls for industry input.\n",
      "\"Cboe's decision to withdraw its filing with the SEC to list and trade shares of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is a function of timing related to the U.S. government shutdown as the end of the review period approaches,\" Cboe said in a statement. \"We plan to resubmit a filing at a later date and look forward to continued discussions with the SEC.\"\n",
      "\"This proposal had a very slim chance of success,\" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro said in an email to clients.Â \"SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has been stressing that the bitcoin market is not yet mature enough for an ETF.\"\n",
      "\"Recent price action seems to confirm this, as we've seen a number of price spikes due to the low liquidity lately. The government shutdown seems to have put further strain on this process. If there was a hope of convincing the SEC before the deadline, it has now disappeared. The market's lackadaisical response to this news is a clear sign that investors are starting to understand: the crypto market is not dependent on any government or financial institution and no single product or service has the power to make or break bitcoin,\" Greenspan said.\n",
      "The latest development in the long-running battle to see a U.S. bitcoin ETF follows the SEC rejectingÂ a second attempt by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook founding fame, who went on to start their own crypto exchange, to list shares of a separate bitcoin ETF last summer.\n",

      "### Current Thought Process:\n",
      "1. Analyzing the latest news, we have one article predicting a potential fall in the value of Bitcoin, with the founder of BCG Digital Ventures stating that Bitcoin could go as low as zero. This negative sentiment is concerning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Another article highlights the withdrawal of a proposal to list a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Cboe BZX Exchange due to the U.S. government shutdown. This is seen as a blow to those who were hoping for a fresh round of investment into the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The third article discusses the launch of a new product suite by Bitfury Group aimed at making the Lightning Network easier for merchants and consumers to use. This could potentially increase adoption and usage of Bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Moving on to price data, we don't have the exact current price, but the last known price was around $3,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this information and my analysis, here is my recommendation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the negative sentiment and concerns about the future value of Bitcoin, it is advisable to be cautious in making investment decisions. The withdrawal of the ETF proposal and the potential fall in value, as predicted by some experts, indicate a level of uncertainty in the market. However, the new product suite by Bitfury Group could potentially have a positive impact on Bitcoin adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the recent market history, the previous decision to \"Hold\" resulted in a positive outcome, with a market movement of 0.7870653182198595% and a target of \"Long\". This suggests that a \"Hold\" position might be a reasonable choice at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering the consecutive \"Hold\" recommendations, it is necessary to take a decisive position in the next recommendation, choosing either \"Long\" or \"Short\". Taking into account the potential fall in value predicted by one of the experts and the withdrawal of the ETF proposal, I would recommend a \"Short\" position for the next investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that this recommendation is not guaranteed and it is important to continue monitoring the market for any new developments or changes that may impact the decision.\n",
