Bitcoin SV (BSV) Logo Unveiled for Rebirth of Original Bitcoin,Bcomm Association,2019-01-03 15:18:00,full,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-sv-bsv-logo-unveiled-for-rebirth-of-original-bitcoin-889141625.html,prnewswire.com,"/PRNewswire/ -- The bComm Association unveils an updated logo for Bitcoin SV (ticker: BSV), chosen from public voting after three Twitter polls in a new form...","LONDON, January 3, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --
The bComm Association unveils an updated logo for Bitcoin SV (ticker: BSV), chosen from public voting after three Twitter polls in a new form of decentralized marketing. The BSV logo is revealed on the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, to mark Bitcoin SV as rebirth of the original Bitcoin. A modernized update of the cryptocurrency's classic logo, the new design reflects Bitcoin SV's roots, while leading a new era for Bitcoin to professionalize.
Â Â Â Â  (Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803908/Bitcoin_SV_Logo.jpg ) 
Emerging from the November 15, 2018 contentious hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, BSV is dedicated to preserve Bitcoin's original design.Â Named for the ""Satoshi Vision"" of Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV's mission is focused: restore the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.Â Unlike paths chosen by Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH/BAB), BSV's roadmap will achieve the world's new money used by billions of people, and the global public blockchain upon major enterprises can confidently build.
With modernized features, the new BSV logo conveys that Bitcoin is ready to grow up:

The B symbol is cleaner and stands upright rather than tilted forward or backward. Â 
""Bitcoin SV"" characters also stand upright.
""Bitcoin"" begins with a capital B, rather than lower case. Â 
""SV"" appears in superscript - reflecting Satoshi Vision as the way forward, while keeping emphasis on the name Bitcoin. Â 
The design color uses ""dragon gold"", honouring the dragon logo of the Bitcoin SV full node implementation which birthed BSV.

This BSV logo was chosen after three Twitter polls of numerous design options developed by the bComm Association. The first-ever organization dedicated to bCommerce (Bitcoin commerce), the bComm Association brings together developers, merchants, exchanges, miners and other Bitcoin network participants.Â bComm Association supports Bitcoin SV as the only stable, scalable blockchain that can achieve a world of bCommerce.
nChain's Jimmy Nguyen, Founding President of the bComm Association, remarks:
""Today marks 10 years since the birth of the Bitcoin blockchain, and this date has more importance now than ever. After too many years of wasteful diversions from the Satoshi Vision, we can now finally celebrate Bitcoin's rebirth - unchained from experimental whims of developer teams who veered away from Satoshi's original plan.Â The new BSV logo represents this pivotal moment for Bitcoin to grow up. In the spirit of Satoshi Vision, we are especially thrilled that BSV supporters around the world chose this logo after multiple rounds of online polling in a new paradigm of decentralized marketing.""
Though Bitcoin SV remains a decentralized cryptocurrency system, the bComm Association will now urge the global Bitcoin ecosystem to adopt this new logo for BSV. Â  Â 
Nguyen adds:
""The Bitcoin SV Node is now the reference implementation for the BSV protocol. To differentiate the full node implementation from the BSV cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin SV Node team at nChain intends to keep its dragon logo for the time being.Â Occupying theÂ 5th position in the Chinese zodiac, the dragon is the mightiest of the signs. It symbolizes leadership, ambition, good fortune, energy, and independence - perfect qualities for a reference implementation to lead Bitcoin to its destined world-changing future.""
In just over one month since emerging as a separate chain and token, the Bitcoin SV ecosystem has quickly grown. More than 50 exchanges now list BSV.Â Numerous wallets have announced exclusive support for BSV - including the user-friendly and popular CashPay, Centbee, HandCash, hivr, and Pixel Wallet. Top Bitcoin applications Keyport TV, Money Button, Yours.org, and others have moved exclusively to BSV. And BSV even has a dedicated tokenisation protocol in Tokenized. For a more comprehensive list of Bitcoin SV services, applications, and developer tools, please visit https://bitcoinsv.io/services/.
For 2019, the bComm Association is dedicated to support technical efforts for massive on-chain scaling of the Bitcoin SV blockchain. BSV has already seen the world's largest blocks - 65 and 64MB - ever mined on a public blockchain. The bComm Association will work with the BCH Professional Stress Test team, nChain and others to further test the BSV blockchain's throughput capacity, and demonstrate Satoshi Vision is the correct roadmap to much bigger blocks and big enterprise use.

Hosted at Wynwood's The Lab Miami, the Hackathon will kick-off with a social mixer for participants and observers on Friday, January 18th at 7:00 P.M. Hacking begins the next day Saturday at 9 A.M. and will continue for about 26 hours until the next morning. Developers must create original code for applications and software that integrate Bitcoin in innovative ways. Hacking ends at 11 a.m. on Sunday morning, so that presentations can begin. A panel of judges will review the submissions. Prizes in BTC will be awarded to the winners.
""Our goal is to get local developers interested in building applications on top of Bitcoin,"" said Doug Carrillo co-founder of Bitstop, one of the largest Bitcoin ATM operators in the world. ""We believe Bitcoin will change the lives of millions of people. It's important to expose as many developers to Bitcoin as possible.""
Judges for the 2019 Miami Bitcoin Hackathon will include Bitstop co-founders Douglas Carrillo & Dainel Vera, local South Florida Bitcoin podcaster Joshua Unseth, and Ryan Brewer, a local Bitcoin developer who hosts regular Miami bitcoin developer meetups.
The first-place winning team will receive the grand prize of 2 BTC (currently worth about $8,000 USD). Second place will be awarded 1 BTC (equivalent to about $4,000 USD.) Subsequent winning placements continue to sixth place, with bitcoin prizes awarded for all.
Developers who want to sharpen their Bitcoin skills can get an edge on the competition before the Hackathon. Bitcoin developer Justin Moon is coming down to Miami to teach his popular Bitcoin programming course BUILDL Bootcamp on January 14th and 15th. Those interested in his course can learn more at MiamiBitcoinHackathon.com.
Bitcoin has grown a lot over the past year. We've seen the price climb as high as $20,000 and drop down to $4,000. Even though the price has been volatile lately, Bitcoin fundamentals couldn't be better. The infrastructure, resources and scaling layers of Bitcoin have grown significantly in size which has laid fertile ground for developers to build applications easier.

According to Ray Youssef, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Paxful, 41% of new users in 2018, hailed from Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa. However, Nigerians who use Paxful to buy Bitcoin, often pay at least 20% more for Bitcoin than international users.
Buy Bitcoin in Nigeria Without Paying Surcharges
Demand for Bitcoin is increasing in Nigeria. In response, a homegrown Bitcoin exchange is making buying Bitcoin easier and more affordable.
Called NairaEx and available at www.nairaex.com, Nigerians can buy Bitcoin at international market rates. NairaEx is also the world's only Bitcoin exchange to allow Nigerians to pay using bank card, Visa QR or GTB 737.
How to Buy Bitcoin at NairaEx
Signing up at NairaEx is easy. Opening an account can be completed in seconds by completing a short sign up form. Once accounts have been verified, users can then complete an order form and specify how much Bitcoin they would like to purchase.
After confirming order amounts, Nigerian users are forwarded to the NairaEx payment gateway. After payments are confirmed, Bitcoin is deposited in user wallets in a matter of minutes.
Using NairaEx, it takes just minutes to Buy Bitcoin. All transactions are also 100% secure. The only question is, why is buying Bitcoin beneficial for Nigerians?
Why are So Many Nigerians Buying Bitcoin?
Bitcoin appeals to both investors and entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Related News 
According to Nigerian Blockchain Solutions Ltd. CEO Mr. Lucky Uwakwe, 51% of people see Bitcoin as a profitable long-term investment. 19% of people use Bitcoin for remittance purposes, and 30% of Nigerians regularly use Bitcoin to shop online or transfer money to friends and family.
In all cases, the appeal of Bitcoin is simple. Bitcoin consistently performs better than the Naira on world currency markets. This makes it easier for Nigerian entrepreneurs to do business internationally. It also gives everyday Nigerians a way to protect personal savings, as the Naira loses value against the Dollar and Euro.
Is Buying Bitcoin a Risk-Free Investment?
Over the past 10-years, Bitcoin has realized phenomenal growth.
In 2009, Bitcoin was worth less than $0.01 (U.S.). Today, Bitcoin is worth over $3,000. However, investing in Bitcoin is not without risk. Prices fell sharply throughout 2018. For this reason, both NairaEx and market commentators like Mr. Lucky Uwakwe, warn everyday Nigerians not to invest more than they can afford in the long or short-term.
Where Can Nigerians Exchange Bitcoin for Naira?
Nigerians who use Bitcoin for remittance and transfer purposes, need to exchange Bitcoin for Naira regularly. For this reason, NairaEx allows verified users to exchange Bitcoin for Naira, just as easily as users can trade Naira for Bitcoin.
100K Nigerians are Already Using NairaEx.com 
NairaEx launched in Nigeria in 2015. As of 2019, over 100 thousand Nigerians are already using NairaEx to buy and sell Bitcoin every day.

Bitcoin's Biggest Hack In History: 184.4 Billion Bitcoin from Thin Air,Charlie Shrem,2019-01-14 01:45:00,timezone unknown,https://hackernoon.com/bitcoins-biggest-hack-in-history-184-4-ded46310d4ef,hackernoon.com,"On Aug. 15 2010, an unknown hacker nearly destroyed Bitcoin. The hacker generated 184.467 billion Bitcoin out of thin air in what has become known as the Value Overflow Incident.","On Aug. 15 2010, an unknown hacker nearly destroyed Bitcoin. The hacker generated 184.467 billion Bitcoin out of thin air in what has become known as the Value Overflow Incident.
Satoshi Nakamoto quickly hard forked the blockchain to remove the 184.467 billion Bitcoins, which is the only thing that saved Bitcoin from dying an early death that day.
Essentially, the code for checking Bitcoin transactions did not work if outputs were so large that they overflowed when summed, and a hacker figured this out and took advantage of it. There is supposed to be a fixed maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin, but the hacker, in a single transaction, created 8,784 times more Bitcoins than ever should exist.
If this hack hadn't been rectified, Bitcoin would likely have died then and there, which would mean the entire crypto space as we know it would not exist. The price of Bitcoin would have plummeted to zero instantly once users realized that it could be minted at will. Bitcoin would have lost all of its trust and reputation.
Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's infamous and anonymous creator, created a code fix within 3 hours of the incident first being reported on Bitcointalk. Early Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen worked alongside Satoshi to bring about a quick resolution.
Within 5 hours of the incident, Satoshi released version 0.3.1 of Bitcoin, which prevented future printing of Bitcoins via this exploit and rewound the blockchain to erase the hacked 184.467 billion Bitcoins.
This was a hard fork, so two different versions of Bitcoin existed in the immediate hours after version 0.3.1 was released. Satoshi monitored the competing blockchains closely and urged miners not to mine the bad chain because doing so would make it take longer for the good chain to become the dominant chain.
Just 19 hours after the incident began, the good chain became the dominant chain according to Satoshi.The bad chain still existed and disrupted some users for at least the next day, but ultimately, the good chain generated from version 0.3.1 became the Bitcoin blockchain everyone uses today.",hackernoon.com,1845,news,US,en,Charlie Shrem,https://cdn.hackernoon.com/hn-images/0*k9jRaIyvH2CzxSth,False,@hackernoon,12.882667,43fd78ea7ee47ab95fc9a8eebb0faa7a

Last year, the SEC delayed or outright rejected bitcoin ETF applications from issuers including Direxion, GraniteShares, ProShares and VanEck.If approved, United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust's holdings would include bitcoin, U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries. In the filing, Wilshire Phoenix cautioned that the fund, if approved, wouldn't replicate a direct investment in bitcoin.'While the Shares are not intended to, nor is their purpose to, replicate a direct investment in bitcoin, they seek to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin with substantially lower volatility than a direct investment in bitcoin and without the uncertain and often complex requirements relating to acquiring and/or holding bitcoin,' according to the filing.By not limiting its holdings to bitcoin, the Wilshire Phoenix product could limit some of the volatility associated with digital currencies.What's NextAs is the case with every other proposed bitcoin ETF, the fate of the United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust lies firmly in the hands of U.S. regulators with little evidence to suggest the SEC and regulatory agencies are poised to change the established tone on bitcoin ETFs.Not surprisingly, the Wilshire Phoenix filing doesn't include a ticker or expense ratio, hallmarks that usually indicate an ETF that has been filed for is close to launch.

Bitcoin Will Still Bite the Dust,Kevin Dowd,2019-01-13 15:15:37,full,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/13/bitcoin-will-still-bite-the-dust/,coindesk.com,"Economic professor Kevin Dowd argues that bitcoin is like the Ford Model T and, while innovative, cannot survive in the long term.","Kevin Dowd is a Professor of Finance and Economics in the Business School at Durham University, and the co-author of the 2015 paper ""Bitcoin Will Bite the Dust.""Â For more on bitcoin's 10th anniversary, check out our new interactive featureÂ Bitcoin At 10.Â Back in August 2014, I discovered that the bitcoin mining industry had the industrial structure of a natural monopoly. A natural monopoly is a market in which production is most efficient with a single producer.This discovery came as a shock, but the implication was clear: Bitcoin could not survive in the long run. As a check, I field tested my reasoning on various people who are economically literate. None disagreed.When I first arrived at that conclusion, bitcoin's price was $379. Since then, its price rose to nearly Â£20,000 and has since fallen to a value $3,621 at the time of writing.Does the subsequent price behavior of bitcoin mean my prediction was wrong? No. I still think that the long-run equilibrium price of bitcoin is zero. It just hasn't bitten the dust yet.My reasoning is based on two simple economic arguments. The first is that the bitcoin mining industry is a natural monopoly and a natural monopoly undermines bitcoin's core value proposition. The second is that in markets with zero regulatory entry barriers, an inferior product cannot survive long-term. Either of these arguments is sufficient to produce my conclusion that the price of bitcoin must go to zero in the long term.Together, they are more than sufficient to establish that conclusion.I have also yet to hear a single intelligent challenge to this argument from the bitcoin community. Instead, the typical response has been personal abuse. Name-calling is no substitute for a reasoned response, however.Let's consider these two arguments in turn.To work as intended, the bitcoin system requires atomistic competition on the part of the miners who validate transactions blocks in their search for newly minted bitcoins. However, the mining industry is characterized by large economies of scale.Indeed, these economies of scale areÂ soÂ large that the industry is a natural monopoly. The problem is that atomistic competition and a natural monopoly are inconsistent: the built-in centralization tendencies of theÂ naturalÂ monopoly mean that mining firms will become bigger and bigger â and eventually produce anÂ actualÂ monopoly unless the system collapses before then.The implication is that the bitcoin system is not sustainable. Since what cannot go on will stop, one must conclude that the bitcoin system will inevitably collapse. The only question is when.I could go on at length about how this centralizing tendency will eventually destroy every single component of the bitcoin value proposition, knocking them down like a row of dominos: the first domino to fall will be distributed trust, Bitcoin's most notable attraction; the system will then come to depend on trust in the dominant player not to abuse its power.This player will become a point of failure for the system as a whole, so the ""no single point of failure"" feature of the system will also disappear. Then pseudo-anonymity will go, as the dominant player will be forced to impose the usual anti-anonymity regulations justified as means to stop money laundering and such like, but which are really intended to destroy financial privacy.Even the bitcoin protocol, the constitution of the system, will eventually be subverted. Every component of the bitcoin value proposition will be destroyed. The bitcoin system will then become a house of cards: there will be nothing leftÂ withinÂ the system to maintain confidenceÂ inÂ the system.There is also the argument that the price of bitcoin must go to zero because an inferior product cannot survive long-term in the absence of regulatory barriers to entry.Imagine you have a market with no entry barriers. The first firm to enter the market has 100 percent of the market share, as bitcoin once did. Competitors then come along and make inroads into the market.Some of these offer products that are superior to the product produced by the first firm, not least because their producers have learned from some of the design flaws in the first firm's product. And eventually superior rivals displace it completely and the market share of the first product goes to zero.There is some evidence to suggest that this process is at work in the bitcoin market: according to CoinMarketCap, bitcoin's share of the cryptocurrency market had fallen to 94.29 percent by April 28, 2013 (the first date for which they provide data) to 52.29 percent by today.This fall has not been uniform â we would not expect that â but the direction of travel is clear: bitcoin is losing its market share. Whether its market share will continue this downward trend and gradually fade out or suddenly go pop is another issue. I suspect the end will come when something triggers a selloff that leads the Bitcoin price to fall its natural long-run level, zero.The history of innovation also supports my belief that bitcoin cannot last indefinitely.The innovators â the early movers in a market â rarely survive long-term under conditions of free entry. An example is the Ford Model T. This automobile was first produced in 1908 and soon came to dominate the market. But competitors learned from its design flaws and built better cars, which eventually stole its market share. The Ford Model T now survives only as an antique.The difference between the Ford Model T and bitcoin, however, is that bitcoin has no antique value. Do I still think that bitcoin will bite the dust? You bet.Rusted carÂ image via Shutterstock",coindesk.com,1153,news,US,en,"CoinDesk,Kevin Dowd",https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/t49lcjsFKGHvlz-y9rmnzLCRuTk=/1200x628/center/middle/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/T2JPNYAJOJEZRI6CU3MEHVLIUQ.jpg,False,@coindesk,12.871682,2f6db8b012bf1467da658abcf615d21c

The bComm Association announces the ElectrumSV wallet for Bitcoin SV (BSV), the rebirth of the original Bitcoin. ElectrumSV is a conversion - for the Bitcoin SV blockchain - of the popular Electrum wallet for Bitcoin. ElectrumSV version 1.0.0 is available at electrumsv.io and is provided for free usage under the open source MIT license.
Â Â Â Â  (Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/807147/ElectrumSV_Wallet_Logo.jpg ) 
The original Electrum wallet was created for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain, and is considered one of the top Bitcoin wallets because of its strong technical feature set. After the August 2017 hard fork which created Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a BCH version of Electrum was created under the name ""Electron Cash"".
More recently, the November 15, 2018 hard fork of BCH led to BSV emerging as its own chain and token, dedicated to preserve Bitcoin's original design.Â Named for the ""Satoshi Vision"" of Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV's mission is focused: Â restore the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale. Â 
This led developers Roger Taylor and Neil Booth to create a new version of the Electrum wallet dedicated to BSV. Roger and Neil were two productive developers of the Electron Cash version of Electrum. Neil also created the ElectrumX Â server software which is used almost exclusively by all Electrum-based wallets. However, finding no future on the Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH/BAB) chain, they decided to create and release the ElectrumSV wallet for the BSV chain. As they explain on the ElectrumSV.io website: "" Bitcoin SVÂ is the only Bitcoin that followsÂ the whitepaperÂ and values being stable and non-experimental, ElectrumSV naturally builds on it.""
ElectrumSV will focus on being a desktop wallet, leaving mobile wallet development to other BSV ventures such as Centbee, HandCash and Cashpay.Â Because it based on both the Electrum and Electron Cash wallets, the ElectrumSV feature set includes:

an advanced interface allowing flexible importing of private keys from other wallets;
integration with hardware wallets such as Bitbox, Ledger and Keepkey; and
management of wallet keys and historical transactions.Â 

Given their more advanced feature set, the Electrum family of wallets (including Electron Cash) are known to be more suited to developers than consumer users. The ElectrumSV team intends to keep and extend the advanced feature set and flexible functionality inherited from Electrum, but will improve functions to be more user-friendly for the ordinary Bitcoin consumer. Â  Â 
ElectrumSV's user-friendly approach begins immediately with a key feature in the first release:Â a coin splitting tool to allow users to easily and safely split their pre-fork BCH coins into BSV coins. This addresses a common request from users since the November 2018 BCH hard fork which led to Bitcoin SV's emergence.
Roger Taylor and Neil Booth remark:
""We agree with the Bitcoin SV message that it's time for Bitcoin to grow up, keep a stable protocol without constant developer experimentation, and move to its next phase for scaling and mass adoption. Â ElectrumSV is contributing to that effort by leaving behind the developer-focused experience, and making a wallet with easy-to-use features for everyone. We intend to continue making more improvements for the future.""
Work on the ElectrumSV project is supported by the bComm Association, the first-ever organization dedicated to bCommerce (Bitcoin commerce) which brings together developers, merchants, exchanges, miners and other Bitcoin network participants. The bComm Association supports Bitcoin SV as the only stable, scalable blockchain that can achieve a world of bCommerce.
nChain, the blockchain research & development firm, and its Bitcoin SV Node team also assisted the ElectrumSV developers. nChain's Jimmy Nguyen, Founding President of the bComm Association, remarks:
""We are thrilled to help Roger and Neil bring the strong legacy of the Electrum wallet to Bitcoin SV. The ElectrumSV team understands that Bitcoin is for everyone, not just for developers.Â That is why their approach to upgrade Electrum into a more user-friendly wallet for BSV is critical to help achieve the Satoshi Vision - a world where billions of people globally use Bitcoin every day.""

The Finance Prof. Who Says Bitcoin's Going to âBite The Dust' Is Wrong,Wes Messamore,2019-01-20 17:20:23,full,https://news.yahoo.com/finance-prof-says-bitcoin-going-172023198.html,yahoo.com,"By CCN.com: Kevin Dowd is a Professor of Finance and Economics in the Business School at Durham University, Northeast England, and the co-author of the 2015 paper 'Bitcoin Will Bite the Dust,' alongâ¦","By CCN.com: Kevin Dowd is a Professor of Finance and Economics in the Business School at Durham University, Northeast England, and the co-author of the 2015 paper 'Bitcoin Will Bite the Dust,' along with market analyst and author, Martin Hutchinson, for the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington DC.

CoinDesk published an op-ed by Dowd Monday, with the title, 'Bitcoin Will Still Bite The Dust,' in which the libertarian finance and economics professor avers that Bitcoin is doomed to failure.

Well what he says exactly is that Bitcoin will 'bite the dust,' and what he means by that is:

Bitcoin can 'not survive in the long run,' and 'I still think that the long-run equilibrium price of bitcoin is zero. It just hasn't bitten the dust yet.'

And technically he might be right, the same way John Maynard Keynes was right when he said:

'In the long run we are all dead.'

-John Maynard Keynes, Dead British Economist

But before we take a look at the two reasons Professor Dowd gives for why Bitcoin will 'bite the dust,' here's an excerpt about him from Wikipedia to give you an idea where he's coming from:

'Dowd's main subject of research is private money and free bankingâmonetary and financial systems that operate without any government intervention and in the absence of any central bank. A related focus of his work is on central banking and other forms of state intervention into economies, most particularly, on deposit insurance, the lender of last resort and bank capital adequacy regulation. He has repeatedly called for the abolition of central banks and an end to state intervention in the financial system.'

So here is an economist who would want Bitcoin to succeed, but doesn't think it will. That's interesting. It makes me think he must have a pretty good argument that Bitcoin will fail.

Again, 'in the long run,' whatever that's supposed to mean.

Story continues

Does Dowd have any claim more specific than Bitcoin will bite the dust 'in the long run?'

If thousands of years from now when humanity is a space-faring, interstellar civilization in the year 40,750, if they're not still using the very blockchain which began with the first Genesis block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, then the ghost of Kevin Dowd can gloat his prediction was true. What use is a prediction like this? If he's so certain as to Bitcoin's demise, will Professor Dowd be so bold as to make a forecast of roughly when Bitcoin will bite the dust?

The Two Reasons Why Prof. Kevin Dowd Says Bitcoin 'Will Bite The Dust'

FIRST he claims Bitcoin is âa natural monopoly':

âTo work as intended, the bitcoin system requires atomistic competition on the part of the miners who validate transactions blocks in their search for newly minted bitcoins. However, the mining industry is characterized by large economies of scale. Indeed, these economies of scale are so large that the industry is a natural monopoly. The problem is that atomistic competition and a natural monopoly are inconsistent: the built-in centralization tendencies of the natural monopoly mean that mining firms will become bigger and bigger â and eventually produce an actual monopoly unless the system collapses before then.'

But this simply isn't true.

There are economies of scale involved in bitcoin mining, sure, but a lot of industries that aren't monopolies have economies of scale. Bitcoin mining happens to be one of them.

Below is a pie chart of the market share of bitcoin miners in terms of hash rate distribution.

Hash rate is how many operations a bitcoin miner's computer is doing in a period of time. The higher the hash rate, the greater the opportunity of solving a hash function (by generating random guesses until your computer finds the correct one), which qualifies you to certify the next block of transactions in the chain and receive a reward in bitcoin.

From Blockchain.com:

An estimation of hashrate distribution amongst the largest mining pools. The graph shows the market share of the most popular bitcoin mining pools. It should only be used as a rough estimate and for various reasons will not be 100% accurate. -Blockchain.com

Does that look like a monopoly to you?

Looks like some pretty healthy competition to me.

And miners themselves are just one major stakeholder in Bitcoin.

There's also the individuals and businesses who hold bitcoin as savings or speculative investment, and who transact business with it.

There are the exchanges.

There are the wallet companies.

And there are the developers for all of these areas.

It's completely inaccurate to portray Bitcoin as a monopoly under someone's central control when it is, in fact, a brilliantly envisioned, highly robust digital economic architecture with a manifold system of checks and balances built into it like the U.S. Constitution.

The Bitcoin blockchain architecture and the vast public digital ledger it has produced on its blockchain constitute the founding digital document of a new economic order based on old principles and new possibilities, and the network of people and computers that maintain it are the founding fathers of a promising establishment.

Which is part of my rebuttal to Prof. Dowd's next contention:

SECOND he claims Bitcoin is âan inferior product':

âThere is also the argument that the price of bitcoin must go to zero because an inferior product cannot survive long-term in the absence of regulatory barriers to entry. Imagine you have a market with no entry barriers. The first firm to enter the market has 100 percent of the market share, as bitcoin once did. Competitors then come along and make inroads into the market. Some of these offer products that are superior to the product produced by the first firm, not least because their producers have learned from some of the design flaws in the first firm's product. And eventually superior rivals displace it completely and the market share of the first product goes to zero.'

But it's not.

Dowd contradicts himself here. First, he says Bitcoin will bite the dust because nobody can survive in the market without getting swallowed up by a bigger beast. Then he literally says Bitcoin will bite the dust because it's too easy for people to get into the market and compete.

And both claims are false. The first claim is false because that's not what's actually happening. The market for bitcoin mining is an oligopoly, not a monopoly.

The second claim is false because Bitcoin is not an inferior product. Dowd is positing that competitors will find a second mover advantage that will prove fatal to Bitcoin, but the second mover doesn't always have the advantage.

And what we've found with Bitcoin, which has a market capitalization in excess of the rest of the planet's cryptocurrencies combined, is a lot of first-mover advantages.

The fact that it came first makes it a very stable boat in the waters. It has the longest, strongest blockchain, and the most battle-hardened network with the most experience weathering bugs and attacks. The fact that it came first has been a major advantage to Bitcoin.

The mere fact of its sheer size gives Bitcoin the benefits of the network effect and makes it the most difficult target for a 51% attack. The old tropes about Bitcoin being outdated because it uses a lot of energy either miss the point of Bitcoin entirely, or are deliberately misrepresenting a difference of design philosophy as Bitcoin being outdated.

This is a network that uses energy and computation on purpose to create a qualified node. That's part of what makes Bitcoin so solid. Characterizations of Bitcoin as outdated because of transaction volume also either miss the point of Bitcoin or are deliberately misrepresenting a difference of design philosophy as Bitcoin being outdated.

Perhaps Bitcoin isn't meant for that, but as equity for a store of value as savings, something for which fewer transactions are necessary, and which is highly valued and sought after by markets.

Or maybe second layer technologies will facilitate the use of Bitcoin for daily commerce in small amounts because an army of developers makes Bitcoin a superior product every day.

The Bitcoin Price Has Leaped Sharply Higher--Here's Why,Billy Bambrough,2019-01-07 08:37:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/01/07/the-bitcoin-price-has-leaped-sharply-higher-heres-why/,forbes.com,"Bitcoin, which many investors and holders are hoping is going to begin 2019 with a bang, has leaped sharply over the last 24 hours...","Bitcoin,Â which many investors andÂ traders are hoping is going to begin 2019 with a bang, has leaped sharply over the last 24 hours, adding some 6% and climbing above the psychological $4,000 mark for the first time this year.
The bitcoin price, which has been languishing at around $3,750 for the last couple of weeks, moved sharply higher after a surge in bitcoin trading volume that sent the original cryptocurrency's market capitalization up over $70 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. The bitcoin price has climbed up above the psychological $4,000 mark for the first time in two... [+] weeks. Getty 
Bitcoin, despite being the most widely traded cryptocurrency with trading volumeÂ into the billions of dollars every day, still struggles with wild price swings due to so-called market whales moving large volumes of bitcoin at above or below the current market value. Just ahead of the bitcoin market spike last night a bitcoin whale moved some 2,500 bitcoin (worth just under $10 million) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, according to the Twitter price tracking bot Whale Alert. The move pushed the daily bitcoin volume up to over $5 billion, a 2019 high.

The jump in the bitcoin priceÂ sent the wider cryptocurrency market higher, with ethereum gaining just over 2% over the last 24 hours, while rippleÂ (XRP) added almost 5%.
""A surge of 6.5% in 30 minutes is not entirely uncommon for bitcoin and could very well be caused by a single large order on an exchange or even by a lack of liquidity in the market,"" said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at brokerage firmÂ eToro. ""What's interesting about this move is that it did bring us above the $4,000 level and so far is holding onto the gains.""
Bitcoin isn't the only major cryptocurrency to see large holders make big moves lately. Since Friday, more than $273 million in ethereum has been transferred in 21 separate transactions, withÂ 10 of the largest transactions from the crypto exchange Bitfinex to unknown wallets, it was reported today by trade news site the Daily Hodl. The largest ethereum move was worth almost $19 million.

Meanwhile, the bitcoin price is being supported by news thatÂ CoinFlex, originally a part of theÂ U.K.Â bitcoin exchange Coinfloor, has announced plans to offer physical bitcoin futuresÂ to Asian investors next month.
The move by CoinFlex, first reported by the Bloomberg newswire, will put it in direct competition with theÂ New York Stock Exchange and Eris Exchange, both expected to be offering similar contracts soon.
The move toÂ physical bitcoin futures is seen as important to help combat manipulation in the market, with some claiming cash-settledÂ contracts leave unregulated bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets open to abuse.Â 
The chief executive of CoinFlex and co-founder of CoinFloor, Mark Lamb, told Bloomberg CoinFlex will offer futures contracts for bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ethereum that can be leveraged up to 20 times.
""Crypto derivatives could become an order of magnitude larger than spot markets and the main thing that's holding back that growth is the lack of physical delivery,"" Lamb said. ""Volumes are reduced because of a problem of trust when it comes to cash-settled trades.""

The First Bitcoin Was Born Ten Years Ago Today. How Far We've Come,Jon Martindale,2019-01-03 09:00:48,full,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/bitcoin-10-years-of-mining-from-genesis-block-to-asic-and-beyond/,digitaltrends.com,"The Bitcoin genesis block was mined 10 years ago today, bringing the first 50 Bitcoins into existence. Since then more than 17 million more have been mined and the hardware used to create new tokensâ¦","OLGA MALTSEVA/AFP/Getty Images
Bitcoin is 10 years old today. You might have read about the decade anniversy of Bitcoin back in October 2018, but that was merely for the original Whitepaper published by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Today is the 10 year anniversary of the day the first Bitcoin came into existence. It's the decade-old anniversary of the mining of the genesis block.
Why is this significant? Well, the genesis block is the very first block in the blockchain technology that powers every function of Bitcoin and its altcoin pretenders. It's a unique link in the chain because it's the very first one â the only block in the entire digital infrastructure that is not tied to a previous block.
This genesis block came into existence on January 3, 2009, so today we celebrate its birth, for good or for bad. Let's look back on a decade of Bitcoin mining and how it's changed over the years.
The early days of mining
In completing the mining of that first block, Satoshi Nakamoto earned 50 Bitcoins for the trouble. Worth nothing at the time, today such a sum could be sold for more than $200,000 and a year ago would have fetched almost five times that.
The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining hardware all over the world is equivalent to that of a small country.

One of the more notable factors of that earliest of mining efforts and those that followed in the months after, was that the rewards were far higher and the difficulty of the mining was a fraction of a percent of what it is today. BitInfoCharts' coverage of Bitcoin mining difficulty over the years highlights that the difficulty remained at a round '1' hash until the very last day of that year. That meant that you could mine Bitcoins with the weakest of consumer grade CPUs and still have a good chance of being rewarded with Bitcoins.
In the years that followed, as exchanges were founded and trading became more organized among Bitcoin evangelists, the difficulty of mining rose significantly, requiring more and more powerful processors, then graphics cards, and then in 2013, the application specific integrated circuits, or ASIC mining hardware, started to appear. Those micro-computers were and are designed specifically to mine Bitcoin and they offer performance far in excess of even the most powerful of graphics cards. That lead to a whole new arms race in the Bitcoin mining wars and the difficulty exploded in turn.

By the end of 2013 Bitcoin difficulty had crested a Gigahash for the first time. That's more than a thousand, thousand, thousand times as difficult as the mining of the genesis block. Since then it's increased thousands of times more and today the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining hardware all over the world is equivalent to that of a small country.
Solving blocks also delivers far less of a reward to miners â just 12.5 Bitcoins per block â and the competition is so fierce that only those with the ability to invest in server farms of ASIC miners with cheap electricity and plentiful, cheap cooling, stand to make much of a profit â especially considering Bitcoin's recent pricing crash.

What is a blockchain?
How to mine Bitcoin
How to buy Bitcoin
 Even though the downturn in the value of the cryptocurrency has lead to the first reduction in Bitcoin mining difficulty in months and the most significant in its history, it seems unlikely that people will ever stop mining it. The whales aren't selling their Bitcoin, so those with the most to lose believe that there isn't much risk in 'HODLing' on a little longer at least.
Over the years to come, Bitcoin mining will continue and the trickle of tokens will turn into a drip as more and more of the maximum 21 million Bitcoins are mined and released into the wild. We passed the 80 percent mark earlier this year, and we're set to pass 83 percent by the end of it. It might take as long as 100 years to mine the very last Bitcoin, with the rewards continue to halve every few years throughout that time. But assuming the cryptocurrency is still around at that point, miners will need to continue in some guise to process transactions on the blockchain. They do have an important job to do, beyond just earning themselves rewards and mining fees.
Where does that leave us? Well, the future of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining is anything but certain, as the wild swings in the cryptocurrency's value suggest. But it seems likely in the near future, at least, that mining will continue as it has done for the past decade. Ever expanding, growing ever more difficult. What that means for Bitcoin's value and the environment that's so affected by the demands of such an expansive network of ASIC hardware, remains to be seen.
The future of Blockchain technology, though, is arguably far more exciting.

"Bitcoin is NOT decentralized: Just 1,000 accounts control 85% of all Bitcoins in the world... and they easily rig market swings to skim profits from the masses",Ethan Huff,2019-01-22 10:44:01,full,https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-01-22-bitcoin-isnt-decentralized-easily-rig-market-swings.html,naturalnews.com,"A sizable number of formerly dormant Bitcoin wallets are mysteriously coming alive, new reports indicate â including the relatively small handful of Bitcoin wallets that collectively hold upwards ofâ¦","(Natural News) A sizable number of formerly dormant Bitcoin wallets are mysteriously coming alive, new reports indicate â including the relatively small handful of Bitcoin wallets that collectively hold upwards of 85 percent of the world's total Bitcoin supply.
Following the recent mega-decline in Bitcoin's value, where the popular cryptocurrency dropped in value from around $20,000 per coin last year to around $3,500 per coin at present, many Bitcoin wallets that have been inactive for anywhere between six months to two-and-a-half years are suddenly 'waking up' â which has investors projecting more wild price swings for Bitcoin in the near future.
It would appear as though Bitcoin's earliest adopters, many of whom have been sitting on somewhat large amounts of the cryptocurrency and doing nothing with it, are suddenly getting in on the action. According to Flipside Crypto, the number of inactive Bitcoin accounts has plummeted from nearly four million back in September to well under three million as of this writing.
'The owners of some of bitcoin's oldest accounts â many of which have long been dormant â have shown signs of life starting in October,' explains Zero Hedge, citing data recently published by Bloomberg about where Bitcoin could be headed now that the old dogs are starting to play the game.
'The actively-traded supply of bitcoins has risen 40% since last summer â¦ This is important because a similar pattern preceded large price swings in 2015 and 2017, most recently foreshadowing the frenzy of (manipulation aided) buying that sent the price of a bitcoin to $20,000 briefly before prices cratered the following year.'

This sudden rush on Bitcoin trading began around the beginning of the new year, when the price of Bitcoin reached what some believe to be a short-term bottom â meaning it could be up, up, up from here, in the opinion of some.
On the other hand, this newfound interest in buying and selling Bitcoin could simply mean that the 'whales' are ready to drive the price up again for a time before selling like mad and raking in all the profits â leaving the little guy with nothing.
'The bitcoin market is notoriously concentrated,' reveals Zero Hedge, debunking the myth that Bitcoin is somehow decentralized and accessible to the everyday man.
'About 1,000 addresses â often referred to as âwhales' control some 85% of all Bitcoins, and include many early investors that have remained relatively inactive during the stratospheric price surge and collapse of the past two years.'
What could, and likely will, happen is that the relatively low price of Bitcoin at present will draw many new amateur investors into the mix, driving up the price to potentially an all-time high. Then, before these amateurs are smart enough to sell off and make a profit, the whales will make their move and siphon all the new wealth into their own pockets â leaving the little guy with nothing.
'For anybody who doubts the power that whales can exert on the price of bitcoin, just look back at the chaos unleashed in September when a mysterious wallet with $720 million in bitcoin aroused from its slumber and started dumping coins,' adds Zero Hedge about the tremendous influence the whales have on the price of Bitcoin.
Keep in mind that, practically speaking, Bitcoin is pretty much useless when it comes to being a practical form of digital currency.

Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin's definitive account book.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work?Â Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it.Â Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit.Â Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability.Â Â Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solveÂ mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC.Â What is a BlockchainÂ Bitcoin's system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code.Â Â The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into.Â Given that all of the Bitcoin network's computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database.Â This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are.Â Â As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing.Â P2P ExplainedÂ Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so.Â Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network's credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger.Â Â The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin's mass adoption in their respective countries.Â Â How Does Bitcoin Make Money?Â Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset's investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility.Â How To Get Bitcoin?Â How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders.Â Â Luckily, even the uninitiated won't be needing a 'bitcoin for dummies' guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchangeÂ to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card.Â Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original).Â Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created?Â Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining.Â Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one's computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset.Â Â How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin?Â Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn't really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing.Â If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up.Â ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin).Â Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results.Â Bitcoin Security ExplainedÂ Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation.Â Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless.Â Being public and decentralized boosts the asset's security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger.Â As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely.Â How To Use BitcoinÂ Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services.Â Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal.Â How to Buy BitcoinÂ Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins.Â Keep in mind that you should be looking for Bitcoin or BTC and not things like 'Bit coin' or 'bitcoin cryptocurrency' because there have been known scams and fake coins, so stick with reputable brokers.Â Where Can I Buy Bitcoin?Â Buying Bitcoin is mostly done through Bitcoin brokers, many of which will ask you for your KYC data (know your customer data: name, address, and so forth).Â As such, some concerns were raised over the asset's security and user anonymity, which is why non-KYC options were also created.Â However, non-KYC Bitcoin buying might not be entirely legal depending on where the buyer lives.Â Â Storing your BitcoinsÂ There are different ways of storing your Bitcoins. Regarded as the safest way of holding Bitcoin, an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or hardware wallet) is usually the go-to option for most people because of how these Bitcoin wallets are not accessible through the Internet and thus keep the asset safe offline.Â By not being connect to the internet, cold wallets have a much smaller risk of being compromised. However, some will prefer to store the asset in hot walletsÂ which run on internet-connected devices (phones, computers, etc.).Â Â Investing in BitcoinÂ Why Is Bitcoin Valuable?Â Scarcity is an important element to why Bitcoin has value. Having unlimited supply will obviously not translate to being a good store of value. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million.Â Another factor to consider is that the asset is being considered by many as 'freedom money' given that it cannot be inflated away, nor can it be censored or confiscated.Â This makes it self-evident that Bitcoins are standing above concepts like sovereignty, user's personal preferences, creeds, and so forth.Â Moreover, the monetary policy some of the newer crypto projects out there can be altered at a moment's notice, whereas Bitcoin's monetary policy was fixed at its inception, meaning that it is a much steadier asset than any of its other digital counterparts.Â Can Bitcoin be converted to cash?Â Bitcoin can be converted to cash through third-party broker exchanges. The process requires the seller to deposit his or her Bitcoins into the exchange and, once verification that the asset was received takes place, a withdrawal request for fiat currency can be made.Â The money will then be wired into the sellers account and usually the broker will require you to use the same account which is connected to it (as to prevent money laundering schemes).Â Another less used method one can resort to are peer-to-peer selling platforms.There are at least 3 things to consider before cashing out your Bitcoin: taxes, fees, and speedÂ Â Â Bitcoin Investing RisksÂ Every investment comes with risk. Bitcoin, albeit being a digital asset, is no different. In fact, there are some risks you should know about when dealing with BTC.Â Regulatory riskÂ Decentralization comes at a price. As Bitcoin makes great strides into our everyday lives and begins to be recognized as legal tender, it inherently becomes a competitor to fiat, or government currency.Â Â Obviously, it can (and many are certain that it already has) become a digital medium for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and other underground market payments.Â This makes it clear that governments will look into either regulate, restrict, or even attempt to ban its use and/or sale.Â Other efforts might include actively enforcing KYC requirements to brokers or having participants reporting transactions over a certain amount.Â Regardless, the lack of Bitcoin regulation, especially in a uniformed manner, will certainly make some weary about its longevity and universality.Â Â Security riskÂ As the Bitcoin mining process barriers of entry get higher and higher, it comes as no surprise that many Bitcoin holders will have acquired it by resorting to one of the many available online exchanges.Â As it happens with everything digital, these exchanges are also risk prone either by malware, glitches or even hackers.Â Â If a hacker takes over one's computer and manages to get his or her hands on a private encryption key, they will be easily able to steal Bitcoin (and remember, Bitcoin transactions are permanent and there is no insurance or refunds).Â The exchanges themselves are honeypots due to how some of their users simply aren't resorting to holding their Bitcoin in safer places.Â Insurance riskÂ Bitcoin accounts and exchanges are usually not insured in any way.Â However, some exchanges have begun to provide Bitcoin insurance to its investors, namely with FDIC insurance for a portion of transactions which involve cash.Â Â Â Fraud riskÂ Bitcoin encryption through private keys allows for ownership verification and transactions to be registered. However, there have been known cases of scammers attempting to sell fake Bitcoin or operating Bitcoin Ponzi schemes.Â Market riskÂ Bitcoin value fluctuates and cryptocurrency volatility is a quite common occurrence in the digital crypto sphere.Â Â As such, Bitcoin price swings are to be expected. As an example of how extreme things can go, Bitcoin fell about 80% in one single day in 2014.Â People have brought up the subject of the Bitcoin bubble time and time again, but the truth is that the project is holding on despite having plenty of competitors.Â So,Â Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?Â A good investment can be defined in many ways. Bitcoin investments can greatly vary due to how some people interpret it as a speculative short-term play while others see it as a hedge against inflation or aim for long-term adoption and appreciation.Â It will come down to one's own perception and assessment of the investment's risk and reward.Â What Are the Issues with Bitcoin?Â Volatility is still and issue with Bitcoin as is the lack of true anonymity. However, the main issue with the digital asset is as its popularity keeps growing, it becomes slower and slower, cumbersome, and, more importantly, expensive to use.Â Transactions take a long time to be validated and fees have skyrocketed, meaning that Bitcoin is slowly walking a path in which might lead to its unviability as medium of exchange. Electricity consumption has also been a source of concern.Â The History: Who created Bitcoin?Â While some people still believe that there is someone who owns Bitcoin, the truth is that Bitcoin has had a somewhat immaculate conception in the world of finance.Â It is a unique historical 'accident' that one might say it would probably be impossible to recreate (as many of the newer digital projects have unfortunately shown us).Â Anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto (who can either be an individual or group of individuals) left the project very early on and as we all know every prominent cryptocurrency creator who sticks around can be turned into a single point of failure of the project, meaning that taking credit for the project could in fact hurt it.Â Moreover, Bitcoins value was near zero for a long time given despite having first mover advantage. That got to fly under the radar of both the public and the regulators unlike the newer projects out there.Â When Was Bitcoin Created?Â The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the original software which runs the asset was released the following year.Â Bitcoin Forking HistoryÂ Throughout Bitcoin's history there have been some accounts of disagreement between miners and developers with even factions being created.Â These led to significant splits in the community which surrounds crypto and the asset, some of which led to the point in which a 'fork' had to be performed on the network.Â Forking happens as developers or miners believe that a significant change must be made in the network's protocol.In this particular case, the process led to the creation of a new type of Bitcoin with a completely different name. If the new coin is set to share the previous coin's transaction history up to the split point, the process is considered to be a 'hard fork'.Â Bitcoin Cash (launched in August 2017), Bitcoin Gold (launched in October 2017), and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (launched in November 2018) were all a result of a hard fork in Bitcoin's network.Â If the fork, however, allows for the protocol to remain compatible with its previous iteration, that it is known as a 'soft fork'.Â Â Bitcoin's functionalities like SegWit are a result of soft forks in the network.Â What is Bitcoin ConcludedÂ While some believe Bitcoin to be the future of currency, others see it as a speculative play.Â Regardless of how people see Bitcoin, the decentralized aspect of the project completely revolutionized finance and the world itself much akin to how gold overcame seashells many, many centuries ago.Â With no central control or oversight from governments or banks, Bitcoin is inessence an unbelievably strong social consensus with a monetary policy written in stone and a max supply which can be compared to a religious dogma.Â FAQÂ Can Bitcoin be Considered a Real Currency?Â Â Bitcoin is referred to by many as a form of digital currency and/or the main alternative to fiat money which is controlled by central entities such as banks.Â Bitcoin differs due to how no monetary authority can issue it and, as we know, currencies offer value due to their ability to operate as a store of value and, obviously, as a unit of exchange.Â Â People who aren't digitally native or who can't go beyond the concept of fiat currency may still wonder what do bitcoins look like but there are other countries which have made great strides into adapting themselves to this new currency.Â Â Countries like El Salvador, for example, have recognized it as legal tender, which means that if you ask someone overÂ there questions like how to get into bitcoin, what is bitcoin and how does it work, they'll have the answer on the tip of their tongue even if they don't know bitcoins definition.Â The revolution might have just begun, and we might see Bitcoin being used on a daily basis much like credit cards.Â Â Why do people want Bitcoins?Â The reasons why people want Bitcoins can greatly vary. While some believe it will be the currency of the future, assuming that we're going digital on all fronts, others just use it for speculative plays and quick profits.Â What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money?Â Mainly, what makes Bitcoin a new kind of money is its digital, decentralized nature. Many crypto enthusiasts call Bitcoin 'freedom money'.Â Your bank accounts can be frozen, your licenses can even be revoked, the list goes on.Â If a government has immunity over their actions and is able freeze your assets on just the slight suspicion of wrongdoing (or if they find out you don't support their 'regime') then it might be the time to do so and start looking at Bitcoin differently because they can try and try again but no one will be able to fully stop peer-to-peer bitcoin or lightning transactions to and from non-custodial wallets, meaning people will still be able to receive and send bitcoins as they please.Â What is the purpose of Bitcoin?Â Bitcoin's original purpose was to provide a way for people to be able to send money over the internet and to provide a digital, decentralized alternative in what concerns payment systems.Â Â This is the main reason why some people out there loveÂ bitcoin more than cash.Â How Many Bitcoins Are There?Â By design, Bitcoins supply is hard capped at 21 million, meaning that its supply is finite.After the asset's supply reaches 21 million, no additional coins will be generated.Â Is Bitcoin a Scam?Â Bitcoin is intangible but its value is certainly real and its presence in the financial world is robust and longstanding.Â With that being said, there are scammers out there who will try to swindle people with nefarious tactics and scams.Â Â Nonetheless, these problems are rooted in human behavior and not in the coin itself. The digital asset's code is open source, and anyone can download and review it.Â Â Can you buy a house with Bitcoin?Â Buying a house with Bitcoins or another digital crypto asset is certainly a very real possibility.Â To do so, one should look for a real estate agency which has experience dealing with Bitcoins and crypto transactions. However, keep in mind that a mortgage on the property might not be possible due to how some banks are still hesitant on the asset.Â Even if the coin is world famous now, there are still many places where you'll be asked what is btc. However, if the seller will accept Bitcoin, the only thing left is to negotiate the selling price in BTC.Â Who controls Bitcoin price?Â Bitcoin is not issued by an entity like a central bank, nor it is backed by a government. Accordingly, monetary policy, and other measurements of economic growth simply do not apply when dealing with Bitcoins.Â However, its price can still be influenced by a variety of factors like the digital asset's supply, the market's demand, the cost of producing it, the miners' rewards, regulations regarding the asset's sale and use, news developments, competing crypto, and so forth.Â How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin?Â The length it takes can vary depending on the block reward's amount (how much will crypto miners will receive for generating a new block).It is estimated that on average a new block is produced every 10 minutes, meaning that a new Bitcoin gets mined approximately every 1.6 minutes.Â Is mining Bitcoin illegal?Â The legality of this process will most likely solely depend on your geographic location.Â As Bitcoin threatens fiat currencies' dominance and governmental control, the digital asset has been declared to be completely illegal in some countries.Â With that being said, ownership and the coin's mining process are still legal in many more countries than not.Â  While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.Â No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.Â In fact, we've gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo HanyeczÂ made BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John's.One could now argue that Bitcoin has now a global brand because of how everyone recognizes it even if they don't really know what it is.Added to that, Bitcoin also has the largest market cap and liquidity pool which is why many find it to be the most attractive coin out there.Â Bitcoin summed upÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating with no type of central control nor oversight from banks or governments, relying solely on its cryptography and peer-to-peer software.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â A public ledger keeps track of all transactions by recording them. Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin's definitive account book.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work?Â Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it.Â Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit.Â Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability.Â Â Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solveÂ mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC.Â What is a BlockchainÂ Bitcoin's system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code.Â Â The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into.Â Given that all of the Bitcoin network's computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database.Â This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are.Â Â As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing.Â P2P ExplainedÂ Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so.Â Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network's credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger.Â Â The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin's mass adoption in their respective countries.Â Â How Does Bitcoin Make Money?Â Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset's investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility.Â How To Get Bitcoin?Â How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders.Â Â Luckily, even the uninitiated won't be needing a 'bitcoin for dummies' guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchangeÂ to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card.Â Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original).Â Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created?Â Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining.Â Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one's computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset.Â Â How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin?Â Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn't really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing.Â If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up.Â ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin).Â Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results.Â Bitcoin Security ExplainedÂ Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation.Â Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless.Â Being public and decentralized boosts the asset's security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger.Â As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely.Â How To Use BitcoinÂ Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services.Â Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal.Â How to Buy BitcoinÂ Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins.Â Keep in mind that you should be looking for Bitcoin or BTC and not things like 'Bit coin' or 'bitcoin cryptocurrency' because there have been known scams and fake coins, so stick with reputable brokers.Â Where Can I Buy Bitcoin?Â Buying Bitcoin is mostly done through Bitcoin brokers, many of which will ask you for your KYC data (know your customer data: name, address, and so forth).Â As such, some concerns were raised over the asset's security and user anonymity, which is why non-KYC options were also created.Â However, non-KYC Bitcoin buying might not be entirely legal depending on where the buyer lives.Â Â Storing your BitcoinsÂ There are different ways of storing your Bitcoins. Regarded as the safest way of holding Bitcoin, an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or hardware wallet) is usually the go-to option for most people because of how these Bitcoin wallets are not accessible through the Internet and thus keep the asset safe offline.Â By not being connect to the internet, cold wallets have a much smaller risk of being compromised. However, some will prefer to store the asset in hot walletsÂ which run on internet-connected devices (phones, computers, etc.).Â Â Investing in BitcoinÂ Why Is Bitcoin Valuable?Â Scarcity is an important element to why Bitcoin has value. Having unlimited supply will obviously not translate to being a good store of value. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million.Â Another factor to consider is that the asset is being considered by many as 'freedom money' given that it cannot be inflated away, nor can it be censored or confiscated.Â This makes it self-evident that Bitcoins are standing above concepts like sovereignty, user's personal preferences, creeds, and so forth.Â Moreover, the monetary policy some of the newer crypto projects out there can be altered at a moment's notice, whereas Bitcoin's monetary policy was fixed at its inception, meaning that it is a much steadier asset than any of its other digital counterparts.Â Can Bitcoin be converted to cash?Â Bitcoin can be converted to cash through third-party broker exchanges. The process requires the seller to deposit his or her Bitcoins into the exchange and, once verification that the asset was received takes place, a withdrawal request for fiat currency can be made.Â The money will then be wired into the sellers account and usually the broker will require you to use the same account which is connected to it (as to prevent money laundering schemes).Â Another less used method one can resort to are peer-to-peer selling platforms.There are at least 3 things to consider before cashing out your Bitcoin: taxes, fees, and speedÂ Â Â Bitcoin Investing RisksÂ Every investment comes with risk.

Bitcoin Exposed Silicon Valley's Ultimate Aim: Making Money,Noam Cohen,2019-01-07 12:00:00,full,https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-exposed-silicon-valley-aim-making-money/,wired.com,"Bitcoin is a prime example of how Silicon Valley touts ""democratization"" and ""decentralization"" as righteous motives when wealth is the ultimate goal.","Bitcoin turned 10 this month, and what a ride it's beenâinitial obscurity; the kind of exponential price spike last seen by Dutch tulip peddlers; the rise of imitators based on its underlying blockchain technology; and, in the past year, a steep, steady decline in price. The old joke about the lifecycle of a Hollywood star applied to Silicon Valley: What is Bitcoin? Get me Bitcoin! Get me a Bitcoin type! What is Bitcoin?The decade since the project's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the 'genesis block' of bitcoins offers more than a parable of faddishness. With its focus on wealth creation (of early adopters) and institutional destruction (of centralized banks, in particular), Bitcoin provides direct access to the character of Silicon Valley. If you think companies like Facebook and Google are about manipulating the public to make money without concern for the damage done to society, then the Bitcoin story should be your urtext.I came to Bitcoin as a journalist relatively early in its history (the price of a coin was $17, but even then it was recovering from a price plunge), and I remember thinking of it as an incredible thought experiment. Some wizard had invented a virtual coin that could not be copiedâan obvious problem for a digital currencyâand that announced to everyone who the owner of that coin was, through a constantly updated, indelible ledger. There were no obvious uses yet; I tracked down a few businesses that accepted bitcoins, one in Vermont, one in Hungary, that nonetheless appeared agnostic about the whole endeavor. Even so, Bitcoin seemed like a potentially powerful online collaboration tool.Was it a way, perhaps, of earning credits within a group that didn't want to exchange money? After all, Wikipedia, too, was code used by a group of enthusiasts to create value; it operates with great transparency and has a most recent version that everyone acknowledges as the one in circulation. But why someone would agree to accept this as payment without some sort of shared belief or project was beyond me. (At the time, my reporting appeared in the business section of a national newspaper, but as should be obvious by now I didn't have much of a knack for business or dystopian fantasy.)Looking back to 2011, however, there were ominous signs. Gavin Andresen, who was the lead developer of the software that operates Bitcoin, told me that he thought of Bitcoin in terms of 'market cap'âthat is, Bitcoin was worth the price of a coin multiplied by all the coins in circulation. The thought experiment had turned into a venture. (At that point, Bitcoin could be valued using Andresen's method at $100 million; by that same calculus, Bitcoin peaked at more than $300 billion in late 2017.)It was unclear to all how seriously to take Bitcoin. Back in 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation began returning donations made in bitcoin because of their legally dubious status, only to switch gears and start accepting them again. One organization eager to solicit bitcoins was the online global muckraking site WikiLeaks. In 2017, a Twitter feed associated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange sarcastically thanked the United States government for making it so hard for the organization to accept ordinary donations beginning in 2010. 'It caused us to invest in bitcoin,' he wrote 'with > 50000% return.'These two qualitiesâthe potential to 'own' part of a growing venture and the purported ability to do transactions outside of government scrutinyâwould come to define Bitcoin and its early growth. In 2012, one Bitcoin expert estimated that a principal use of the digital currency was to purchase small amounts of drugs on Silk Road. And as this use gave some value to bitcoins, those looking to make a quick, IRL buck started buying bitcoins as an investment. New investors made the coins more valuable, which made other potential investors take notice.

Hosted at Wynwood's The Lab Miami, the Hackathon will kick-off with a social mixer for participants and observers on Friday, January 18th at 7:00 P.M. Hacking begins the next day Saturday at 9 A.M. and will continue for about 26 hours until the next morning. Developers must create original code for applications and software that integrate Bitcoin in innovative ways. Hacking ends at 11 a.m. on Sunday morning, so that presentations can begin. A panel of judges will review the submissions. Prizes in BTC will be awarded to the winners.



""Our goal is to get local developers interested in building applications on top of Bitcoin,"" said Doug Carrillo co-founder of Bitstop, one of the largest Bitcoin ATM operators in the world. ""We believe Bitcoin will change the lives of millions of people. It's important to expose as many developers to Bitcoin as possible.""
Judgesfor the 2019 Miami Bitcoin Hackathon will include Bitstop co-founders Douglas Carrillo & Dainel Vera, local South Florida Bitcoin podcaster Joshua Unseth, and Ryan Brewer, a local Bitcoin developer who hosts regular Miami bitcoin developer meetups. The first-place winning team will receive the grand prize of 2 BTC (currently worth about $8,000 USD). Second place will be awarded 1 BTC (equivalent to about $4,000 USD.) Subsequent winning placements continue to sixth place, with bitcoin prizes awarded for all.
Developers who want to sharpen their Bitcoin skills can get an edge on the competition before the Hackathon. Bitcoin developer Justin Moon is coming down to Miami to teach his popular Bitcoin programming course BUILDL Bootcamp on January 14th and 15th. Those interested in his course can learn more at MiamiBitcoinHackathon.com.
Bitcoin has grown a lot over the past year. We've seen the price climb as high as $20,000 and drop down to $4,000. Even though the price has been volatile lately, Bitcoin fundamentals couldn't be better. The infrastructure, resources and scaling layers of Bitcoin have grown significantly in size which has laid fertile ground for developers to build applications easier.

Bitcoin to find NEW bottom? Traders' optimistic DESPITE new BTC price plunge,Tom Fish,2019-01-28 14:15:00,full,https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1078820/bitcoin-price-news-btc-usd-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-news-latest,express.co.uk,BITCOIN slumped to a new low on Monday morning. Yet some traders remain upbeat despite BTC's bearish price action.,"Bitcoin began 2019 is a relatively buoyant state and even displayed rare signs of stability. However, the flagship cryptocurrency soon returned to its turbulent ways and nosedived in value in the early hours of today, Monday, January 28. But some bitcoin traders believe there are actually optimistic signs, after analysing the BTC moving average.Moving averages are calculated by adding the closing price of bitcoin for a number of time periods and then dividing this total by the number of time periods. Bitcoin has traditionally started pumping around one year on average before it's halving dateTrader Moon OverlordAlex Melen, an American cryptocurrency trader, recently touted reasons for bullish sentiment relating to bitcoin.Mr Melen pointed out how the last time that bitcoin crossed under the 50 and 200 moving average across four days was when 2014/2015's bear marked finally bottomed.When a currency bottoms out, it means the stock has reached its low point and could be in the early stages of an upward trend.READ MORE: BTC and crypto mining âuses DOUBLE the energy required to mine GOLD' Bitcoin price news: Some traders believe there are optimistic signs for the crypto (Image: Getty) BTC price news: The bitcoin moving average could be a reason for bullish sentiment (Image: Getty)And this potentially auspicious event has struck bitcoin again.So there is a chance bitcoin could find a longer-term bottom in the coming weeks and months, as parallels continued to be drawn between the cryptocurrency's previous and current price conditions.And Moon Overlord, a pseudonymous crypto trader, is also an optimistic pundit believing that a bottom is on its way.Moon Overlord has cited historical analysis to express: 'Bitcoin has traditionally started pumping around one year on average before it's halving date.'READ MORE: Bitcoin WEAKENING as PLUNGE APPROACHES â but here is why you should not panicAnd as the next issuance shift is slated to occur during May 2020, BTC could begin trending higher in only a few months.However, while the aforementioned comments make it seem like a rally is imminent, others are less confident.Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital recently noted that although BTC is unlikely to fall further â less than $3,000 is possible â this market is not yet ready to run.The decentralist, who has been overtly skeptical of banks, noted that instead of falling further, BTC may begin to range trade, potentially between $2,500 and $4,500 for much of 2019.Pompliano's comments came weeks after Fred Wilson, a leading venture capitalist, took to his personal blog to remark that the broader crypto market may take much of 2019 to bottom out.READ MORE: Bitcoin price news: Crypto FLOP as bitcoin plunges AGAIN Bitcoin price news: Could we be in the early stages of an upward trend?

Today, you can use bitcoins to pay for goods and services all over the world. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and the current standard for them, has driven the market. Many experts considered it thebest cryptocurrency to trade due to its greater liquidity.Once you have decided to buy and sell bitcoins, you need a unique bitcoin address orcrypto wallet where you can store your bitcoins. A bitcoin wallet address works much like an email address and can be used to pay for goods and services and to receive payments and gifts.Software keeps your wallet on your computer, tablet or mobile device and/or a web-based wallet may be used. Nevertheless, you may wish to avoid keeping your bitcoins at an exchange, since they can be vulnerable to hacking.Overview: Buying Bitcoin in South AfricaVarious countries in Africa have started to develop a market in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Furthermore, the major regional economic hub of South Africa presently leads the rest of the continent in cryptocurrency adoption and blockchain development.In addition to being a medium of exchange, bitcoins have become an alternative vehicle for trading and investing in South Africa.While buying bitcoin in South Africa is relatively easy, finding a suitable broker or exchange to buy through can present more of a challenge.Not every broker will take on South African clients, but the award-winning full-service forex, ETF and cryptocurrency broker XTB currently accept clients from the country. With respect to taxation, the South African Revenue Services (SARS) does not define the word 'currency' in the Income Tax Act. This basically means that cryptocurrencies themselves are not subject to taxation.The SARS states, 'Cryptocurrencies are neither official South African tender nor widely used and accepted in South Africa as a medium of payment or exchange. As such, cryptocurrencies are not regarded by SARS as a currency for income tax purposes or Capital Gains Tax. Instead, cryptocurrencies are regarded by SARS as assets of an intangible nature.'Nevertheless, the value of any given amount of cryptocurrency can be determined in South African Rand (ZAR) given the exchange rate. This means that any profits or income from cryptocurrency trading can be subject to taxation under the law of gross income. Basically, any South African dealing in cryptocurrencies could be liable to pay taxes on income derived from trading them. Despite the erroneous perception of the complexity involved in trading cryptocurrencies, the process can be very simple for anyone with a bank account. The rest of the article will give step-by-step instructions on how to go about buying bitcoins in South Africa.Step 1: Open an Account at a Cryptocurrency ExchangeBefore diving into Bitcoin trading, you should be fully aware of the risks and have some knowledge onhow to trade cryptocurrency. To begin, you will need to have a bank account with money to be able to upload or deposit money to an exchange, although some exchanges accept PayPal, credit cards and electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments. Next, you must open an account at a cryptocurrency exchange that accepts users from South Africa to start buying and selling bitcoin. South Africans generally use two crypto-exchanges for trading: iceCUBED (ice3X) and Luno. Both exchanges accept deposits from bank accounts that, once cleared, allow you to trade bitcoins. Exchanges represent the safest and most secure way of purchasing bitcoins for people just starting out.IceCUBED allows its clients to purchase and trade in bitcoin, as well as many other alternative cryptocurrencies known as altcoins. Other cryptos available to trade include: Litecoin, Etherium, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ada, Dash, Neo and Montero. IceCUBED also offers a mobile trading app for iOS and Android devices, and its desktop trading platform is pictured below.The Luno exchange currently only offers trading in Ethereum and bitcoin, and includes an app for mobile trading. Once you have opened and used your account with an exchange, you can withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange into your personal bitcoin wallet. Pictured below is Luno's bitcoin trading interface.In addition to using the two local exchanges, South Africans can acquire and trade bitcoins through the following:LocalBitcoins.com: This website specializes in networking local people that are looking to buy and sell bitcoins. The site allows you to advertise whether you want to buy or sell bitcoins and lets you trade using the localbitcoins.com website. Trading generally takes place with bank transfers and escrow accounts, but you can make arrangements to meet with other bitcoin traders in person and trade for cash.Credit or debit card purchases: If you plan to use your credit or debit card to purchase bitcoins, you can visit CEX.IO. Once you register and enter your credit card into the system, you can deposit funds and ultimately buy bitcoins. The transactions for bitcoin must be in EUR or USD on the CEX.IO exchange, which charges a 3.5% credit card fee plus a $0.25 fee for deposits.Buy and sell bitcoins at a Bitcoin ATM: The first bitcoin vending machine appeared in Sandton City, North Johannesburg. The BTM can be used to purchase and sell bitcoin for cash during regular business hours. Nevertheless, in order to use the bitcoin vending machine, you must have a bitcoin wallet installed on your smartphone, which has the QR code that can be read by the BTM and used to deposit or withdraw the bitcoins you have traded. The BTM also buys and sells Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Dash, Litecoin, Zcash, Monero and Dogecoin.Related content: HOW TO BUY RIPPLE IN SOUTH AFRICAStep 2: Get a Bitcoin WalletIf you want to retain full control over your bitcoins, you must withdraw them from the exchange or other source where they were acquired to a personal bitcoin wallet. Basically, a bitcoin wallet consists of software that allows you to communicate with the bitcoin network.The wallet software gives you the capability of notifying the network when you want to send and receive transactions. It can be installed on a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Alternately, you can use a web-based wallet that does not require a download. For highly secure bitcoin storage, a hardware wallet can be purchased, which consists of a peripheral device you connect to a network.Every wallet account consists of two elements: your public address, which is like an email address used to receive bitcoin, and your private key, which would be the equivalent of your password in an email account. Your private key allows you to make payments and purchases with your bitcoin and, much like your email password, it must be kept secret.If a person obtains the private key to your bitcoin wallet, he or she can empty your account. The only way to get your bitcoins back once the transaction is made is if the person with your private key decides to return them voluntarily.In South Africa, the following wallet types can be downloaded:Desktop wallets: These wallets include Armory, Atomic Wallet and Bitcoin Core Wallet and require you to install them on your desktop. Ultimately, you have the responsibility of protecting your assets and doing backups. Your desktop should be secure and protected by anti-virus software. Mobile wallets: This type of wallet lets you take your bitcoins in your pocket and includes Bitcoin Wallet, Conoimi Wallet and Green Address. If merchants accept bitcoins, you can pay in brick and mortar stores by scanning a QR code or by using an NFC tap to pay option.Web-based wallets: You can access these wallets from anywhere with an internet connection, and they include BitGo and Blockchain.info. You have to be especially careful not to lose your password with this type of wallet. The wallets do not keep your private keys, so even if they are hacked, your bitcoins remain safe.Step 3: Get Paid in BitcoinOnce you have begun operating in bitcoins, you may want to accept them as payment on your website or at your place of business. For online purchases, you can use a checkout system such as BitPay, which facilitates payment for buyers with bitcoins.In addition, you can download the blockchain.info merchant application, an app that keeps your wallet on your Android phone or tablet. This app allows you to accept payment in any amount of ZAR in bitcoin using the latest exchange rate. Payfast.co.za, another South African gateway provider, gives users the ability to pay in bitcoin by converting it to ZAR.Final ThoughtsBuying bitcoins in South Africa can be as easy as using your credit or debit card at an ATM, thanks to the BTM in Johannesburg. By following the steps outlined above, you can start trading bitcoin in just a few hours once approved by an exchange or broker.The two local South African cryptocurrency exchanges, Luno and iceCUBED, could service most if not all of your bitcoin and cryptocurrency needs. You can also easily trade bitcoins using credit cards, the Johannesburg BTM or through a cryptocurrency broker.",benzinga.com,1933,news,US,en,"Contributor,Jay,Julie Hawk",https://cdnwp-s3.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/21034642/rawpixel-656709-unsplash-1-768x982.jpg?width=1200&height=800&fit=crop,False,@benzinga,12.791069,de4c7dd6b4763d0df290d51baea39309

Visit Booth 3755 at NRF to see the new Bitcoin ATM.,"January 10, 2019 11:08 AM Eastern Standard Time LOUISVILLE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bitcoin ATM pioneer Bitstop has partnered with KIOSK Information Systems (KIOSK), the largest custom self-service solution provider in North America, to create an innovative Bitcoin ATM platform enabling customers to easily buy and sell digital currency on the spot. KIOSK will be featuring the newest Bitstop ATM model at the 2019 NRF Big Show in booth #3755. 
 Bitstop's innovative software platform paired with KIOSK's industry-leading hardware sets a new standard in the Bitcoin ATM Industry, an industry that has grown from nothing five years ago to over 4,000 Bitcoin ATMs in 2018 (coinatmradar.com). Growth projections for this new niche ATM category are expected to exceed 10,000 installations world-wide in the next two years alone. Retailers in the US and Internationally are taking notice because these ATMs are a great way to monetize existing floorspace while driving in-store foot traffic. Bitcoin ATMs are popping up in mainstream retail storefronts such as supermarkets, malls, convenience stores, gas stations, as well as hotels & airports. Bitcoin is a digital currency which has seen hyper growth in recent years due to a surge in demand for the scarce digital asset by retail customers who want to invest. It's still early days and access to Bitcoin can be complicated or confusing. Bitcoin ATMs solve this problem by making the process simple. In four easy steps, you can buy Bitcoin instantly. Customers don't have to wait days for their Bitcoin or deal with complicated exchanges that provide little or no education. On the solution partnership announcement, Bill Butler, KIOSK CEO, said, 'We're excited to partner with Bitstop on this Bitcoin ATM solution. They have a great reputation in the Bitcoin space and are one of the premier operators in the Crypto ATM industry.' Andrew Barnard, Bitstop's Co-Founder, states, 'Our goal is to sell thousands of Bitcoin ATMs globally over the next few years. While the market is currently still in its infancy, we predict that within five years, it will be normal to see a Bitcoin ATM when you're out shopping, traveling or pumping gas. To get to that point, we know it must be incredibly easy for the consumer to use, and for the retailer to operate. This solution partnership combines Bitstop's four years of experience developing and operating a fleet of 100 Bitcoin ATMs with KIOSK's 25+ years of industry leading design and engineering experience. The end result is a simple, secure, and reliable Bitcoin ATM exchange platform that is beneficial to both the consumer and the deploying retailer.' NRF demonstrations in KIOSK booth #3755.

What do the next 10 years hold for bitcoin?,Anthony Cuthbertson,2019-01-03 12:47:41,full,https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-birthday-cryptocurrency-anniversary-satoshi-nakamoto-future-predictions-a8708576.html,independent.co.uk,"Bitcoin was meant to offer a solution to economic chaos, but after 10 years it is still a long way from fulfilling its potential","What do bitcoin, Paddington Bear and the Queen have in common? Thanks to various quirks in their creation, backstory or family history, all three have two birthdays. For bitcoin, these two anniversaries fall on 31 October, which marks the publication of a paper describing a revolutionary electronic cash system, and 3 January, the date the first block of bitcoins was mined.Its birth came as a reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, with bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto alluding to this in a line of text placed in the first block of bitcoin's to be produced.The text read: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""Bitcoin was meant to offer a solution to such economic chaos, not reliant on banks, governments or any other centralised institutions to operate. But in the decade since its inception, bitcoin's promise to turn the traditional financial system on its head clearly hasn't come to pass, and opinion is divided over whether it ever will.Its remarkable price gains in 2017 helped it to gain mainstream attention but it is still a long way before bitcoin or any other spin-off cryptocurrencies ever replace traditional currencies.Some experts believe recent industry movements suggest that they can, at least in some ways. The introduction of the state-backed Petro cryptocurrency in Venezuela and rumours that Facebook is working on a blockchain-based form of digital cash are perhaps the first rumblings of this happening.On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared. It came less than a year after the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto detailed the cryptocurrency in a paper titled 'Bitcoin: A peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System'ReutersOn 22 May, 2010, the first ever real-world bitcoin transaction took place. Lazlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins â the equivalent of $90 million at today's prices Lazlo HanyeczBitcoin soon gained notoriety for its use on the dark web.

The machine allowed people to exchange bitcoins for cashReutersThe world's biggest bitcoin exchange, MtGox, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after losing almost 750,000 of its customers bitcoins.

So what do the next 10 years, or 20 birthdays, hold for bitcoin? One thing many cryptocurrency analysts agree upon is that price volatility will steadily decrease, thanks to a combination of its finite supply and regulation designed to help the market stabilise and mature.""Whilst some critics still argue, for varying reasons, as to the longevity of bitcoin, the next 10 years should at the very least provide many more talking points and events to document its life,"" David Thomas, director of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker GlobalBlock, told The Independent.""If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right.""Bitcoin's 10th birthday has prompted speculation about the cryptocurrency's futureBitcoin's underlying blockchain technology is also expected to continue to drive an entire industry of new applications. Vladislav Dramaliev, head of digital marketing at aeternity, believes this is where bitcoin's real promise lies.Mr Dramaliev describes bitcoin's inception as starting a ""curious revolution"", but believes the word ""evolution"" will be more appropriate to describe the next decade of bitcoin and blockchain's growth.""One of the most incredible developments is that, 10 years after that first block was mined, there is actually a whole industry based around this fantastic technology. Today we have a mind-bogglingly diverse range of individuals and companies in the sphere, covering every possible spectrum of opinion, vision for the future, and agenda,"" he said.""The public blockchain infrastructure is getting better and better, more developers are getting interested in blockchain applications, more entrepreneurs are looking for the next killer app, and more users are playing with digital assets on a blockchain. I don't expect this process to slow down.

I'm As Certain As EverÂ âÂ Bitcoin's Revolution Is Only Just Beginning,Tim Draper,2019-01-12 11:59:07,full,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/12/im-as-certain-as-ever-bitcoins-revolution-is-only-just-beginning/,coindesk.com,"I've been through the ups and downs with bitcoin, and I am as certain as ever that the bitcoin revolution is coming, says Tim Draper.","Tim Draper is a founding partner of Draper Associates and headmaster at Draper University.For more on bitcoin's 10th anniversary, check out our new interactive feature Bitcoin At 10.Â ---------------------------------------------------------------It wasn't 10 years ago, but more like 15, when I first saw the potential for aÂ digital currency. I've been through some big up and downs in bitcoin. But today, I'm more certain than ever that the bitcoin revolution is coming.In 2004, I learned from a wealthy Korean industrialist that people were paying real-world money for digital items like weapons to use in massively multiplayer video games. The game was 'Lineage,' which was taking Seoul by storm.It got me thinking that there was an amazing business in virtual goods coming.Later, Joel Yarmon first introduced me to bitcoin in about 2011. He brought in Peter Vincennes and his company Coinlab to pitch us. Bitcoin was a new currency that could be used to store value and pay for anything, not just for advancement in a video game.I quickly absorbed the basics of bitcoin: miners, wallets and such. The decreasing number of bitcoins available to be mined over time meant that the price of a bitcoin would increase in value as fewer bitcoins were mined and usage increased. In fact, as bitcoins spread and their usage increased, it was likely that the currency would become more valuable.Coinlab would become a bitcoin-focused innovator and miner. We made a small investment in the company. My son Adam started an accelerator called Boost VC, dedicated to bitcoin (and blockchain) companies. He was the first investor in Coinbase.Around that time, I asked Peter if I could buy $250,000 worth of bitcoin. He bought some for me at about $6 each and stored them in Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange at the time. He said he would also buy a high-speed mining chip from Butterfly Labs to get us even cheaper bitcoin. Both of these efforts went south.First, the mining chip was delayed. Rather than shipping it to Peter as ordered, Butterfly Labs used the chip to mine bitcoins for themselves. By the time Peter received the ASIC chips, mining had dramatically increased in difficulty. Meanwhile, the bitcoin I had bought was 'lost' by Mt. Gox.But something important happened with the failure of Mt. Gox. The price of bitcoin only dropped about 20 percent, and the currency continued to be traded on other exchanges. I was flabbergasted and fascinated.I realized that the demand for this new digital currency was so strong that even a huge theft would not keep bitcoin from creating a new way for us to transact, store and move money. Since the financial crisis, people were losing their confidence in government or 'fiat' currencies. I went on to back a number of the Boost VC bitcoin companies, and as I was discovering more and more uses, an enormous opportunity arose.And something happened that gave me another shot at getting involved in the bitcoin opportunity. The U.S. Marshall's office confiscated the bitcoins owned by the Silk Road, an online drug marketplace, and almost 30,000 bitcoins were put up for auction. I looked at this as an opportunity to rebuy the bitcoins I lost.The market price then was $618 per bitcoin. At the last minute, I decided to bid higher than market price. I bid $632 and won all of the bitcoins!After the inevitable buyer's remorse for paying a higher price than anyone else was willing to pay, I thought about how I could best drive a positive use for these bitcoins with a tainted past. I decided that I would use them to support the proliferation of bitcoin through emerging country marketplaces where people didn't have confidence in their own currencies.Many people in such countries are not 'bankable.' Banks lose money on people who don't have enough to make all the paperwork worthwhile. Banking regulations set up to protect the little guy have actually kept the little guy from participating in the economy â almost guaranteeing that he will remain 'the little guy.' There are billions of 'unbanked.'Avish Bhama, one Boost entrepreneur with a company called Mirror helped me figure out a good plan to spread the currency to emerging country markets. The idea was to allow people from developing nations the ability to invest in anything (even to go short against their own currency) by using bitcoin as the 'rails,' the conduit for the trades.Mirror later changed its business model, but companies I backed later â BitPesa in Africa, Bitpagos in Latin America, and CoinHako in Southeast Asia â are making the emerging world their marketplace.I remain impressed by the possibilities for bitcoin and blockchain. Bitcoin is a currency that is accepted everywhere without any government friction or interference, a stored value solution that doesn't require a holder to keep a room full of metals and art, and a frictionless currency that can move automatically based on a contract, without the usual drag that comes from regulations and accounting rules.But there are many other uses.A bitcoin wallet can also be used as an escrow for a contract in transition, as a redistribution of an estate or as a transfer agent to distribute payments, dividends or shares of stock. Blockchains can keep track of money, data, inventory, contracts, etc., and 'smart' contracts can be designed such that they anticipate eventualities and automatically distribute funds appropriately. Corporations can use the blockchain to automatically pay employees their wages and benefits, pay shareholders their dividends, and pay noteholders their interest and principal payments, all with precise accuracy and automated accounting.The blockchain can manage three-way transfers with ease, and eventually will handle retail transactions without the need for credit or debit cards. Insurance companies can use it to manage their claims and automate collections. Real estate escrows and titles can all be done quickly and easily between buyer and seller. Drugs and food can be authenticated by blockchain to guarantee their origins.And the U.S. Government can manage social security, welfare, Medicare, worker's comp, disability and all their data verification of citizens and businesses with bitcoin and the blockchain, since blockchain is the perfect government employee.It is honest, incorruptible, secure, and fair.Many industries will have to go through fundamental changes to adapt to the advent of this new way of thinking. People will have to learn that the bank, being the trusted third party for centuries will soon be replaced by computers that now monitor their holdings through the blockchain. Banking will be simpler, safer and easier than relying on people to do the monotonous work in some brick-and-mortar facility.It is interesting to note that countries, now recognizing that they are in competition with one another, are trying to make sure they win the bitcoin economy. The smartest of these are either allowing bitcoin to prosper or recognize that they need a light touch in regulating bitcoin to attract all the creativity, money and startups that are flooding into the field.The U.S. was wise to leave the internet unregulated and free because all the internet entrepreneurs created startups domestically and the economy around the internet blossomed. Keeping its regulatory hands light should help innovators stay in the U.S.There are many parallels between bitcoin now and the internet in 1994. In 1994, the internet was just for hobbyists and hackers. I remember when I first used the Internet, the only things I could do were to buy diamonds and try to break into NORAD. There were very few uses. It took many years for the internet to become mainstream, but when it did, it transformed industries.The long-term vision for bitcoin is to give the world economic emancipation. The potential if bitcoin is only limited by the imaginations of the entrepreneurs who work to drive this new virtual economy. To monitor and keep it honest, I believe that the community of users will ultimately self-regulate, possibly eclipsing or obviating the need for the various governments to regulate the crypto world.I've been through the ups and downs with bitcoin, and I am as certain as ever that the bitcoin revolution is coming.It is here to bank the unbanked, to democratize economic opportunity and to reevaluate governance. I expect that it will change everything from the banks and the financial system to healthcare, to democracy, even theÂ government.Tim Draper image via CoinDesk archives",coindesk.com,1153,news,US,en,"CoinDesk,Tim Draper",https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rRxY_xNg_a7F1LjENciKlp7-cyc=/1200x628/center/middle/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/7P7WTLGC2RHPRHUC3FWSNES7S4.jpg,False,@coindesk,12.761847,1724a345b07dfe5bfaa1d7106272bfda

Robbins, most famous for firewalking during his motivational speaking engagements and selling his 'Personal Power' self-help series to professionals looking to maximize their potential, has in later years taken to giving advice about finances and wealth management.

The article reads, in part:

Bitcoin is decentralized. No single bank, government, company or individual owns the network or has control over it. This means that your accounts can never be frozen, a government cannot devalue the currency, it can be used in every country, and, more ominously, because of the anonymous nature of bitcoin, the technically savvy can avoid taxation and use bitcoin as payment for any kind of illegal good or service.

While this is the first article to appear on Robbins' website about Bitcoin, last year he described it as a gamble. He told CNBC:

I think [bitcoin] is very iffy. I don't have a clue. I look at that as it's like going to Vegas.

He went on to say that 'it's just for fun' and he knows he 'could lose.' He prefers index funds for investments, at least as of that time.

Tony Robbins shares the mindset you need to invest in bitcoin from CNBC.

Tony Robbins: The Next Bitcoin Jesus?

We can speculate that the posting of an article on his website regarding Bitcoin is likely dipping his toes in the water. If the article garners a lot of attention and and it seems like something his client base would be interested in, it might not be long before Robbins is the next Bitcoin evangelist, educating the masses and teaching people how not to get rekt.

Of course, Bitcoin already has its share of evangelists and professional speakers. Andreas Antonopoulos primarily travels the world addressing audiences on the nature and importance of Bitcoin, and his book Mastering Bitcoin is considered one of the most important books on the subject.

Story continues

Before joining the Big Block crusade and fomenting a fork of the Bitcoin network into Bitcoin Cash, Roger Ver's evangelism was so fervent and frequent that he was dubbed 'Bitcoin Jesus' within and without the community.

One thing is for certain: Robbins has a wide reach. If he were suddenly to become a Bitcoin proponent during the next bull run, it could feasibly take him from millionaire to billionaire, regardless of how his own crypto portfolio worked out.

The company, which exclusively supports the Bitcoin payment protocol, confirmed that its vision of a better and more open financial system could not be achieved with Bitcoin Cash, adding that it would spend 100% of its resources on Bitcoin and its second-layer payment solutions instead.

OpenNode aims to process bitcoin transactions in real-time to boost the digital currency's adoption among enterprises and businesses. It supports Lightning Network, a second-layer payment protocol launched to confirm Bitcoin transactions away from the main chain. The efforts led OpenNode to raise $1.5 million in seed funding from investor Tim Draper.

Accept Bitcoin Cash and Take $1.5 Million

Ver, who believes that Lightning Network is an inferior solution to solve Bitcoin's scalability issues, attempted to match Draper's bid. He confirmed that he would invest $1.5 million into the OpenNode project if they readily accept Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin as their only payment processing protocol. Excerpts from his statement:

'I don't need one share whatsoever [for my investment]. All I require is [OpenNode] to work on payment processing of Bitcoin Cash, the version of Bitcoin that can actually scale to become the money for the world.'

Ver predicted â through a Moore Law-enabled algorithm â that it would take close to two centuries for the world to board the Lightning Network solution. But in the case of Bitcoin Cash, the time would reduce to just shy of 50 years.

'Bitcoin cannot become the money for the world in a reasonable amount of time with its block size limited to 1 megabyte to 4 megabytes,' he added. 'Even with Schnorr's signature, you are still looking at far more time for BTC to be ready for the world than you are with Bitcoin Cash thanks to Moore's Laws.'

Story continues

The community was quick to respond to Ver's claims against Bitcoin, with many bashing him for twisting mathematics to suit his agenda. CryptoTesla on Twitter argued that the Bitcoin Cash CEO was ignoring the fact that Bitcoin could scale in the next 100 years while being progressive about his project.

'Have these people never heard of Moore's Law? On top of this, he assumes BTC will never have a Block Size increase in over 100 years? In summary: his numbers for BTC have no progress in them while his numbers for BCH have more progress than the growth we saw last decade.'

A Peer-to-Peer Conference for the Whole Bitcoin Community,Bitcoin Magazine,2019-01-30 21:30:04,full,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-2019-peer-peer-conference-whole-bitcoin-community,bitcoinmagazine.com,"Billed as 'A Peer-to-Peer Conference,' Bitcoin 2019 will be held at SVN West in San Francisco, California, hosted by BTC Inc., from June 25â26, 2019.","The first major Bitcoin conference, Bitcoin 2013, was held in San Jose, California. Organized by the Bitcoin Foundation, it was centered on Bitcoin specifically and the more pragmatic issues that Bitcoin was trying to solve, particularly in the areas of Bitcoin technology, Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin business and regulatory issues.Writing for Bitcoin Magazine at the time, Vitalik Buterin commented, 'For long-time Bitcoin users, events like this are particularly emotional; here, for the first time, we are able to see fellow Bitcoin users, whom we have loved, worked with and had heated arguments with over forums or Skype/IRC chat for many months or years as something more than just a username. Entire companies, existing only âon the cloud' before this day, are finally reunited.'This summer, billed as 'A Peer-to-Peer Conference,' Bitcoin 2019 will be held at SVN West in San Francisco, California, hosted by BTC Inc, from June 25â26, 2019. In a blog post announcing the event, BTC Inc CEO David Bailey noted that Bitcoin 2019 was so named to harken back to that earlier conference 'when the Bitcoin community was unified and nerds filled the hotel lobby until the early morning while dreaming of what Bitcoin could become.'The Bitcoin community has grown considerably since 2013, and it has experienced its share of growing pains along the way. People who are passionate about the technology have had differing viewpoints about its direction. As a result, even as Bitcoin has matured and the blockchain ecosystem has evolved, the community itself has become somewhat fractured.Bailey sees Bitcoin 2019 as an opportunity to help rekindle the 'sense of shared wonder and spontaneous commitment to realizing Bitcoin's potential,' as it was back in 2013.'We want to be able to provide a platform that brings together leaders in the Bitcoin community, along with creators, developers, newbies and enthusiasts, in order to allow for new ideas to freely flow among the people who care most about building the Bitcoin of the future,' Bailey told Bitcoin Magazine.'We want to help drive the conversation beyond simply scaling Bitcoin. We want to showcase what's possible to build with Bitcoin, without breaking BTC's consensus rules, which are rigid.'Attracting and Supporting New Growth in BitcoinBailey's hope is that this event will bring together people from across Bitcoin's ideological and political spectrum. He is quick to point out that this is not a 'Bitcoin Maximalist' or an 'anti-any-other-crypto-or-fork' event; however, it is unmistakably a Bitcoin/BTC conference.'We're working hard to help curate the content of the conference so that people who aim to be unifying with fresh ideas and cool projects built on Bitcoin are able to have their voices heard,' he says. 'We're not here to argue how big a block needs to be or what Satoshi's original vision was â that debate has already happened. BTC is BTC. Everything else is not BTC, and this is an event for BTC.'He added, 'We are coming at this from the perspective that this is a Bitcoin BTC event, but it's not âanti-other-crypto.' Regardless of what other projects people have worked on or supported, we want people to not feel excluded from Bitcoin. Just check everything else at the door and come build Bitcoin with us â¦ at least for a couple of days at the conference.'To that end, Bitcoin 2019 has reached out to a wide array of industry leaders and developers to participate in the event. Among the preliminary list of speakers are Bill Barhydt, Matt Corallo, Diego Gutierrez, Dan Held, Jimmy Song, Erik Voorhees, Jihan Wu and Bitcoin Magazine's own Aaron van Wirdum. More speakers will be announced in the near future.'This is not a pay-to-play event,' Bailey emphasizes. 'The easy part is finding the showcase-worthy projects. We actively seek out and learn about the cool things that are going on. We talk to people all over the world constantly about their new projects they're working on. The hard part will be deciding which ones we will be able to carve out time for at the conference.'Anyone interested in participating in Bitcoin 2019 as a speaker, panelist or presenter is encouraged to contact the organizers.In order to make the conference accessible to the greatest number of people possible, tickets will initially be priced at $100. There is also a virtual hackathon 'for ideas built atop and around Bitcoin and the Lightning Network' associated with the event in the works.Bitcoin 2019 is powered by Bitcoin Magazine and produced by BTC Inc.",bitcoinmagazine.com,6284,news,US,en,Bitcoin Magazine,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/t_share/MTc5Mjk3ODA5NzAxODczMzAz/bitcoin-2019-a-peer-to-peer-conference-for-the-whole-bitcoin-community.png,False,,12.733796,8e862eb2043d42edba2db0379f86607f
"Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency Prices In 2019: What The Year Ahead Has In Store",David Thomas,2019-01-01 10:30:01,full,https://www.ibtimes.com/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-prices-2019-what-year-ahead-has-store-2747308,ibtimes.com,"2018 was a dreadful year for cryptocurrency prices, but 2019 may see a reversal of fortunes for bitcoin and other virtual currencies.","It was the American writer and entrepreneur Mark Twain who said, 'Prophesy is a good line of business, but it is full of risks.'So, as we turn our backs on a frankly dreadful 2018 for crypto markets and face 2019, it's firstly time for us to see who is taking the risk to stick their neck out on crypto price predictions, and secondly for us here at GlobalBlock to note what we see as being key drivers for the market. Let's begin with predictions.Mike Novogratz (the ex-Goldman Sachs billionaire fund manager and founder of Galaxy Digital) has given various predictions throughout 2018 which have been scrutinized, particularly as some of these have been less than accurate. Nevertheless, he recently suggestedÂ it's realistic to expect Bitcoin to reach $20,000 next year. Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer of Bitcoin payment service provider Bitpay, was also quoted as saying that a price point of $20,000 is reasonable for Bitcoin in 2019.On the other hand, Calvin Ayre (founder of CoinGeek and a major backer of Bitcoin SV) believes Bitcoin will go to zero in 2019. This doesn't reflect an overall bearish attitude towards crypto but is more the result of a belief that Bitcoin has now been superseded by more scalable technology and solutions.Tom Lee (CEO of market research firm Fundstrat) and Sam Doctor (Fundstrat's quant strategist) have had a brutal year, considering some incredibly positive predictions for Bitcoin in 2018 which failed to materialize. Whilst their outlook for 2019 isn't quite so bullish as some, they still believe a Bitcoin price of $36,000 is achievable.Next up, let's have a look at what GlobalBlock consider to be the key areas that could have the biggest impact on market prices and particularly Bitcoin next year. The cryptocurrency industry has to date been viewed as the Wild West; an analogy that is regularly wheeled out in any new immature financial market sector. Governments and institutions have been looking at the space over the last year and are poising themselves to make big moves, but hesitancy is the dominant force at present until assessment is made on how best to introduce regulation. KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations have become more stringent in recent years, which has begun to tighten up the market and cut down on 'bad actors', and most within the industry are eagerly anticipating more oversight and regulation. As Casey Kuhlman, cofounder and CEO of blockchain tech firm Monax, put it, 'the industry can and should benefit from transparency, speed, efficiently and reliability' afforded by regulation.The United Kingdom's Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently revealed that crypto exchanges operating in the U.K. pose low risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. This provides a good starting point and hopefully as 2019 progresses and expected regulation arrives, there will be increased trust in the industry, and institutional investors will be more confident to enter the market.An ETF proposal was first submitted by VanEck and start-up SolidX, who partnered with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in early 2018. An ETF would be considered a reputable endorsement of Bitcoin which could bring further interest from institutional investors. So far, however, no such approval has been forthcoming from the SEC. There were a series of major rejections throughout 2018, with Gemini (the Winklevoss brothers-owned exchange) being the main applicant and one particular day seeing no fewer than nine dismissed in one go. The verdict on SolidX's proposal is set to be reviewed Feb. 27.And so, we come to our predictions for 2019, a chance for us to take a deep breath, and commit to print our thoughts and expectations for Bitcoin and the market over the next 12 months.With the highs of December 2017 feeling like a lifetime ago, Bitcoin has continually fallen during 2018. If we look at previous trends, it takes on average around 67 weeks for Bitcoin to recover and proceed to new all-time highs. If you follow this logic, then Bitcoin would be heading towards US $20,000 in the second quarter of 2019. However, this is highly optimistic and whilst such highs should be reached again in the future, this short timeframe isn't realistic, given the hesitancy that will exist from a bruised investor base after this year. With positive news, ETFs and regulation, we believe Bitcoin will recover to the $8,000-10,000 levels during 2019. Given where the price is today, it would make 2019 a decent year on balance.Bitcoin has made strides to combat transaction speed and bottleneck issues by implementing SegWit and Lightning, both of which help manage and ease the network more efficiently without actually changing the block size. However, Bitcoin is under threat from its own hardfork: Bitcoin Cash. When the fork occurred in August 2017, developers tried to take the brand and name âBitcoin' over to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (Bitcoin Cash even owns the domain bitcoin.com, branding itself as Bitcoin when it isn't.)Bitcoin Cash, and its own hardfork Bitcoin SV (BSV) are innovations of the initial idea of Bitcoin. We use the word innovation loosely here due to the fact Bitcoin Cash is just set a larger block size to combat the scaling problem; if their network was to become as popular and widely used that 8MB blocks were filled, they could just raise it further.To conclude, 2019 is setting itself up to be the most interesting time for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We particularly look forward to how Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV develop in relation to Bitcoin, which has some commentators speculating it is make or break for the founding cryptocurrency. One thing for certain is that cryptocurrency will continue to make headlines in one way or another and we believe there are many reasons to be positive in the year ahead for both cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology itself.David Thomas is director and cofounder at GlobalBlock.",ibtimes.com,873,news,DE,en,David Thomas,https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/12/31/bitcoin-prediction.jpg,False,@IBTimes,12.718159,d65abcb5b5afc80d1231327f91e11261
Coinbase Has Still Not Issued Bitcoin SV to Customers,P. H. Madore,2019-01-04 10:24:24,full,https://news.yahoo.com/coinbase-still-not-issued-bitcoin-102424951.html,yahoo.com,Coinbase has yet to give Bitcoin Cash holders their Bitcoin SV from the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that happened November 15th 2018. The fork away from Bitcoin Cash by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre'sâ¦,"Coinbase has yet to give Bitcoin Cash holders their Bitcoin SV from the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that happened November 15th 2018.

The fork away from Bitcoin Cash by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre's preferred chain, called Bitcoin SV or 'Satoshi's Vision,' happened November 15th. The hash war was widely reported in CCN and elsewhere. The result was two forks of Bitcoin Cash. Just like the original Bitcoin Cash hard fork, this meant users who had money on the Bitcoin Cash chain would now by right have money on the Bitcoin SV chain.

Poloniex by Circle Had a Pre-Fork Solution

Poloniex led the way and allowed both pre-fork trading and a convenient way for users to be sure their coins would 'split' properly. All one had to do was make a deposit to their Bitcoin Cash wallet prior to the fork. Poloniex would take care of the rest. Many used this as an opportunity to initially 'dump' their Bitcoin SV, even before it was officially live on its own blockchain.

The 'hash war' that ensued resulted in Bitcoin ABC and Roger Ver retaining control of the 'BCH' (Bitcoin Cash) ticker on the majority of exchanges. Calvin Ayre eventually called for a 'cease-fire,' demanding that neither chain claim the previously unified mantle. Bitcoin ABC did not agree to this. The result is that exchanges which list both tokens now have BCH (Bitcoin ABC), which is the dominant fork of the original Bitcoin Cash, and BSV, which is Bitcoin SV.

Coinbase users who were holding Bitcoin Cash at the time of the fork are entitled to Bitcoin SV, just as those who were holding Bitcoin at the time of the original Bitcoin Cash hard fork were entitled to Bitcoin Cash.

User Repeatedly Requests His Bitcoin SV And Is Stonewalled By Coinbase

Coinbase delays Bitcoin SV withdrawals.

However, as an exasperated user wrote to CCN, Coinbase has yet to release Bitcoin SV to anyone.

Across multiple e-mails over a few weeks, Coinbase assures the user, who will remain anonymous, that he will receive his Bitcoin SV, but will not provide any further details. They do mention that while they will allow withdrawals apparently whenever they feel like it, there will be no trading or deposits.

Story continues

The week of Christmas, our informant responded to a reply from Coinbase on Christmas Eve:

I already read that generic update before I wrote you. Your team hasn't updated us for 5 weeks since then. It is about time for a further update. Please provide something better than just rehashing what you already have on your website, we deserve better.

To this, Coinbase said:

Thanks for contacting Coinbase Support. I understand the importance of your digital currency and thank you for your patience with us. I've taken a look at your case and am working with a specialist to address your issue properly. Please note that these reviews are typically completed within 5-7 business days. Thanks again for your understanding.

The same day, Coinbase said:

Following the BCH hard fork and conclusion of the hash war, Bitcoin SV has confirmed the creation of a new coin, BSV. Coinbase intends to allow customers to withdraw BSV at a future date, though we do not currently intend to support trading, buys or sells. We will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.

Our frustrated informant wrote back on the 28th of December:

It's already been 7 WEEKS since that last update. 'We will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.' â so I think that I am entitled to an additional update. You have been busy adding new trading pairs, but cannot ensure that coins that your clients own can be given to them for them to use. That is unacceptable. Please escalate this to someone whom can provide a better answer.

Then, earlier this week, on the 2nd of January, Coinbase finally gave an answer with some substance:

I understand your frustration and I wish that there was more that I could do. However, we will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.

Notice how Coinbase repeats themselves after the user complains that he already had this information.

Will Coinbase Users Ever Realize Gains from Bitcoin SV Fork?

Meanwhile, users of other wallet services and exchanges have had their BSV for weeks, and were even able to cash out at the all-time high of over $200. At time of writing, Bitcoin SV was trading just under $90.

It would seem that, given the high volume of users Coinbase has (over 10 million), the overall Bitcoin SV market has yet to fully discover its price if hundreds of thousands (potentially) Bitcoin SV coins have been locked away in Coinbase's custody.

Reddit users have also been wondering for some time when they will receive their BSV.

The U.S. Government Shutdown Has Delivered A Surprise Blow To Bitcoin,Billy Bambrough,2019-01-24 07:45:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/01/24/the-u-s-government-shutdown-has-delivered-a-surprise-blow-to-bitcoin/,forbes.com,"Bitcoin has been struggling over the last 12 months due to sky-high expectations after its massive 2017 bull run that saw the bitcoin price leap from under $1,000 at the start of the year to almostâ¦","Bitcoin has been struggling over the last 12 months due to sky-high expectations after its massive 2017 bull run that saw the bitcoin price leap from under $1,000 at the start of the year to almost $20,000.
The bitcoin price has fallen steadily over the last 12 months, slipping to lows of near $3,000 as bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors fret over delays to network upgrades, lackluster institutional investment, and heavy-handed regulators. Now, in a surprising development, the on-going U.S. government shutdown has forced the withdrawalÂ of a closely-watched proposal to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Cboe BZX Exchangeâdealing a blow to those who'd hoped the long-awaited bitcoin ETF would bring a fresh round of investment into the stagnating market.Â 
 The bitcoin and cryptocurrency market has lacked direction over the last few months, moving steadily... [+] lower as investors feel for a floor. Getty The bitcoin ETF proposal, broughtÂ by investment firm VanEck and financial services provider SolidX, has faced an uphillÂ battle forÂ approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to concerns the bitcoin price is susceptible to market manipulation.

The decision to withdraw the application amid the U.S. government shutdown, announced in an SEC filing, saw the bitcoin price dip slightly though it remains around the $3,500 it's been trading at since early January.
WithÂ many SEC staff furloughed because of the partial closure of the U.S. federal government and the regulator's deadline to decide on the application fast approaching, Cboe Global Markets decided to pull the VanEck and SolidX application with the view to reapply at a later date. ""The SEC is affected by the shutdownâ¦ we were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop. And so, instead of trying to slip through or something, we just had the application pulled and we will re-file and re-engage in the discussions when the SEC gets going again,"" Jan van Eck, the chief executive of VanEck,Â told CNBC.
 The bitcoin price has been on a steady downward trend for the last 12 months. CoinDesk 
The SEC had set a deadline of February 27 to decide on the bitcoin ETF proposal after repeated delays and calls for industry input.
""Cboe's decision to withdraw its filing with the SEC to list and trade shares of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is a function of timing related to the U.S. government shutdown as the end of the review period approaches,"" Cboe said in a statement. ""We plan to resubmit a filing at a later date and look forward to continued discussions with the SEC.""
""This proposal had a very slim chance of success,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro said in an email to clients.Â ""SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has been stressing that the bitcoin market is not yet mature enough for an ETF.""
""Recent price action seems to confirm this, as we've seen a number of price spikes due to the low liquidity lately. The government shutdown seems to have put further strain on this process. If there was a hope of convincing the SEC before the deadline, it has now disappeared. The market's lackadaisical response to this news is a clear sign that investors are starting to understand: the crypto market is not dependent on any government or financial institution and no single product or service has the power to make or break bitcoin,"" Greenspan said.
The latest development in the long-running battle to see a U.S. bitcoin ETF follows the SEC rejectingÂ a second attempt by the Winklevoss twins of Facebook founding fame, who went on to start their own crypto exchange, to list shares of a separate bitcoin ETF last summer.
With a U.S. bitcoin ETF now off the immediate agenda, investors will be looking towardsÂ major global stock exchanges offering bitcoin futures contracts andÂ the highly-anticipated Bakkt bitcoin platform.

Bitcoin price news: Bitcoin has surpassed the $4k mark this week (Image: Getty )'It's simply unreasonable to expect such a massive turnaround in such a short period of time.'But Mr Thibault added: 'Even though crypto prices are trending downward, crypto aficionados have not given up on the asset class. There are still plenty of development teams working to build the necessary infrastructure for cryptocurrencies, which will allow Bitcoin in particular, to thrive.'A new all-time high for cryptocurrencies will either occur two-three years from now, when improved technology can deliver on mainstream adoption and daily usability, or when enough new money enters the arena and spurs a new mania for cryptocurrencies.'Nicholas Cawley, Daily FX analyst, said the cryptocurrency could drop further before Bitcoin pushes towards the $7 to $8,000 range. Bitcoin price news: The price of the cryptocurrency has fluctuated since Sunday (Image: CoinMarketCap)He told Express.co.uk: 'While BTC dropped over 80 percent last year, here may still be a further washout before the price stabilises.'On the charts the September 2017 swing low at $2,970 and the July 2017 low at $1,790 look realistic targets.'If these targets are hit I would expect a lot of âloose holders' to have finally exited Bitcoin, leaving the way for BTC to press higher and back towards the $7,000 to $8,000 range.'Mr Cawley said a cull of other alt-coins could prompt interest in Bitcoin and traders still interested in the crypto market, investing money in the 'market leader.' Bitcoin price news: Some analysts are doubtful the cryptocurrency will reach the highs of 2017 (Image: Getty )'Bitcoin will remain the market no.1 next year and its market dominance will grow from its current 52 percent to in excess of 65 or maybe more.'Other analysts have looked at Bitcoin's daily sentiment scores, which looks at the conversation over Twitter in the last 24 hours.It has been positive throughout 2019 so far and this could suggest further gains for Bitcoin.Joshua Frank, cofounder of cryptocurrency analytics platform TheTIE.io, said: 'We saw that daily sentiment peaked on January 4th and while it has fallen slightly, it has remained positive.'Given the historic correlation between bitcoin sentiment and price, this would suggest further gains for the cryptocurrency.'",express.co.uk,555,finance,GB,en,Amani Hughes,https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/22/750x445/1069146.jpg,False,,12.695579,031d55d2e5089f60ed92a620ff4bf751

Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin's definitive account book.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work?Â Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it.Â Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit.Â Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability.Â Â Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solveÂ mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC.Â What is a BlockchainÂ Bitcoin's system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code.Â Â The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into.Â Given that all of the Bitcoin network's computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database.Â This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are.Â Â As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing.Â P2P ExplainedÂ Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so.Â Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network's credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger.Â Â The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin's mass adoption in their respective countries.Â Â How Does Bitcoin Make Money?Â Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset's investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility.Â How To Get Bitcoin?Â How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders.Â Â Luckily, even the uninitiated won't be needing a 'bitcoin for dummies' guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchangeÂ to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card.Â Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original).Â Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created?Â Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining.Â Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one's computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset.Â Â How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin?Â Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn't really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing.Â If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up.Â ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin).Â Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results.Â Bitcoin Security ExplainedÂ Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation.Â Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless.Â Being public and decentralized boosts the asset's security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger.Â As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely.Â How To Use BitcoinÂ Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services.Â Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal.Â How to Buy BitcoinÂ Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins.Â Keep in mind that you should be looking for Bitcoin or BTC and not things like 'Bit coin' or 'bitcoin cryptocurrency' because there have been known scams and fake coins, so stick with reputable brokers.Â Where Can I Buy Bitcoin?Â Buying Bitcoin is mostly done through Bitcoin brokers, many of which will ask you for your KYC data (know your customer data: name, address, and so forth).Â As such, some concerns were raised over the asset's security and user anonymity, which is why non-KYC options were also created.Â However, non-KYC Bitcoin buying might not be entirely legal depending on where the buyer lives.Â Â Storing your BitcoinsÂ There are different ways of storing your Bitcoins. Regarded as the safest way of holding Bitcoin, an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or hardware wallet) is usually the go-to option for most people because of how these Bitcoin wallets are not accessible through the Internet and thus keep the asset safe offline.Â By not being connect to the internet, cold wallets have a much smaller risk of being compromised. However, some will prefer to store the asset in hot walletsÂ which run on internet-connected devices (phones, computers, etc.).Â Â Investing in BitcoinÂ Why Is Bitcoin Valuable?Â Scarcity is an important element to why Bitcoin has value. Having unlimited supply will obviously not translate to being a good store of value. Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million.Â Another factor to consider is that the asset is being considered by many as 'freedom money' given that it cannot be inflated away, nor can it be censored or confiscated.Â This makes it self-evident that Bitcoins are standing above concepts like sovereignty, user's personal preferences, creeds, and so forth.Â Moreover, the monetary policy some of the newer crypto projects out there can be altered at a moment's notice, whereas Bitcoin's monetary policy was fixed at its inception, meaning that it is a much steadier asset than any of its other digital counterparts.Â Can Bitcoin be converted to cash?Â Bitcoin can be converted to cash through third-party broker exchanges. The process requires the seller to deposit his or her Bitcoins into the exchange and, once verification that the asset was received takes place, a withdrawal request for fiat currency can be made.Â The money will then be wired into the sellers account and usually the broker will require you to use the same account which is connected to it (as to prevent money laundering schemes).Â Another less used method one can resort to are peer-to-peer selling platforms.There are at least 3 things to consider before cashing out your Bitcoin: taxes, fees, and speedÂ Â Â Bitcoin Investing RisksÂ Every investment comes with risk. Bitcoin, albeit being a digital asset, is no different. In fact, there are some risks you should know about when dealing with BTC.Â Regulatory riskÂ Decentralization comes at a price. As Bitcoin makes great strides into our everyday lives and begins to be recognized as legal tender, it inherently becomes a competitor to fiat, or government currency.Â Â Obviously, it can (and many are certain that it already has) become a digital medium for illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and other underground market payments.Â This makes it clear that governments will look into either regulate, restrict, or even attempt to ban its use and/or sale.Â Other efforts might include actively enforcing KYC requirements to brokers or having participants reporting transactions over a certain amount.Â Regardless, the lack of Bitcoin regulation, especially in a uniformed manner, will certainly make some weary about its longevity and universality.Â Â Security riskÂ As the Bitcoin mining process barriers of entry get higher and higher, it comes as no surprise that many Bitcoin holders will have acquired it by resorting to one of the many available online exchanges.Â As it happens with everything digital, these exchanges are also risk prone either by malware, glitches or even hackers.Â Â If a hacker takes over one's computer and manages to get his or her hands on a private encryption key, they will be easily able to steal Bitcoin (and remember, Bitcoin transactions are permanent and there is no insurance or refunds).Â The exchanges themselves are honeypots due to how some of their users simply aren't resorting to holding their Bitcoin in safer places.Â Insurance riskÂ Bitcoin accounts and exchanges are usually not insured in any way.Â However, some exchanges have begun to provide Bitcoin insurance to its investors, namely with FDIC insurance for a portion of transactions which involve cash.Â Â Â Fraud riskÂ Bitcoin encryption through private keys allows for ownership verification and transactions to be registered. However, there have been known cases of scammers attempting to sell fake Bitcoin or operating Bitcoin Ponzi schemes.Â Market riskÂ Bitcoin value fluctuates and cryptocurrency volatility is a quite common occurrence in the digital crypto sphere.Â Â As such, Bitcoin price swings are to be expected. As an example of how extreme things can go, Bitcoin fell about 80% in one single day in 2014.Â People have brought up the subject of the Bitcoin bubble time and time again, but the truth is that the project is holding on despite having plenty of competitors.Â So,Â Is Bitcoin a Good Investment?Â A good investment can be defined in many ways. Bitcoin investments can greatly vary due to how some people interpret it as a speculative short-term play while others see it as a hedge against inflation or aim for long-term adoption and appreciation.Â It will come down to one's own perception and assessment of the investment's risk and reward.Â What Are the Issues with Bitcoin?Â Volatility is still and issue with Bitcoin as is the lack of true anonymity. However, the main issue with the digital asset is as its popularity keeps growing, it becomes slower and slower, cumbersome, and, more importantly, expensive to use.Â Transactions take a long time to be validated and fees have skyrocketed, meaning that Bitcoin is slowly walking a path in which might lead to its unviability as medium of exchange. Electricity consumption has also been a source of concern.Â The History: Who created Bitcoin?Â While some people still believe that there is someone who owns Bitcoin, the truth is that Bitcoin has had a somewhat immaculate conception in the world of finance.Â It is a unique historical 'accident' that one might say it would probably be impossible to recreate (as many of the newer digital projects have unfortunately shown us).Â Anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto (who can either be an individual or group of individuals) left the project very early on and as we all know every prominent cryptocurrency creator who sticks around can be turned into a single point of failure of the project, meaning that taking credit for the project could in fact hurt it.Â Moreover, Bitcoins value was near zero for a long time given despite having first mover advantage. That got to fly under the radar of both the public and the regulators unlike the newer projects out there.Â When Was Bitcoin Created?Â The Bitcoin white paper was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and the original software which runs the asset was released the following year.Â Bitcoin Forking HistoryÂ Throughout Bitcoin's history there have been some accounts of disagreement between miners and developers with even factions being created.Â These led to significant splits in the community which surrounds crypto and the asset, some of which led to the point in which a 'fork' had to be performed on the network.Â Forking happens as developers or miners believe that a significant change must be made in the network's protocol.In this particular case, the process led to the creation of a new type of Bitcoin with a completely different name. If the new coin is set to share the previous coin's transaction history up to the split point, the process is considered to be a 'hard fork'.Â Bitcoin Cash (launched in August 2017), Bitcoin Gold (launched in October 2017), and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (launched in November 2018) were all a result of a hard fork in Bitcoin's network.Â If the fork, however, allows for the protocol to remain compatible with its previous iteration, that it is known as a 'soft fork'.Â Â Bitcoin's functionalities like SegWit are a result of soft forks in the network.Â What is Bitcoin ConcludedÂ While some believe Bitcoin to be the future of currency, others see it as a speculative play.Â Regardless of how people see Bitcoin, the decentralized aspect of the project completely revolutionized finance and the world itself much akin to how gold overcame seashells many, many centuries ago.Â With no central control or oversight from governments or banks, Bitcoin is inessence an unbelievably strong social consensus with a monetary policy written in stone and a max supply which can be compared to a religious dogma.Â FAQÂ Can Bitcoin be Considered a Real Currency?Â Â Bitcoin is referred to by many as a form of digital currency and/or the main alternative to fiat money which is controlled by central entities such as banks.Â Bitcoin differs due to how no monetary authority can issue it and, as we know, currencies offer value due to their ability to operate as a store of value and, obviously, as a unit of exchange.Â Â People who aren't digitally native or who can't go beyond the concept of fiat currency may still wonder what do bitcoins look like but there are other countries which have made great strides into adapting themselves to this new currency.Â Â Countries like El Salvador, for example, have recognized it as legal tender, which means that if you ask someone overÂ there questions like how to get into bitcoin, what is bitcoin and how does it work, they'll have the answer on the tip of their tongue even if they don't know bitcoins definition.Â The revolution might have just begun, and we might see Bitcoin being used on a daily basis much like credit cards.Â Â Why do people want Bitcoins?Â The reasons why people want Bitcoins can greatly vary. While some believe it will be the currency of the future, assuming that we're going digital on all fronts, others just use it for speculative plays and quick profits.Â What makes Bitcoin a new kind of money?Â Mainly, what makes Bitcoin a new kind of money is its digital, decentralized nature. Many crypto enthusiasts call Bitcoin 'freedom money'.Â Your bank accounts can be frozen, your licenses can even be revoked, the list goes on.Â If a government has immunity over their actions and is able freeze your assets on just the slight suspicion of wrongdoing (or if they find out you don't support their 'regime') then it might be the time to do so and start looking at Bitcoin differently because they can try and try again but no one will be able to fully stop peer-to-peer bitcoin or lightning transactions to and from non-custodial wallets, meaning people will still be able to receive and send bitcoins as they please.Â What is the purpose of Bitcoin?Â Bitcoin's original purpose was to provide a way for people to be able to send money over the internet and to provide a digital, decentralized alternative in what concerns payment systems.Â Â This is the main reason why some people out there loveÂ bitcoin more than cash.Â How Many Bitcoins Are There?Â By design, Bitcoins supply is hard capped at 21 million, meaning that its supply is finite.After the asset's supply reaches 21 million, no additional coins will be generated.Â Is Bitcoin a Scam?Â Bitcoin is intangible but its value is certainly real and its presence in the financial world is robust and longstanding.Â With that being said, there are scammers out there who will try to swindle people with nefarious tactics and scams.Â Â Nonetheless, these problems are rooted in human behavior and not in the coin itself. The digital asset's code is open source, and anyone can download and review it.Â Â Can you buy a house with Bitcoin?Â Buying a house with Bitcoins or another digital crypto asset is certainly a very real possibility.Â To do so, one should look for a real estate agency which has experience dealing with Bitcoins and crypto transactions. However, keep in mind that a mortgage on the property might not be possible due to how some banks are still hesitant on the asset.Â Even if the coin is world famous now, there are still many places where you'll be asked what is btc. However, if the seller will accept Bitcoin, the only thing left is to negotiate the selling price in BTC.Â Who controls Bitcoin price?Â Bitcoin is not issued by an entity like a central bank, nor it is backed by a government. Accordingly, monetary policy, and other measurements of economic growth simply do not apply when dealing with Bitcoins.Â However, its price can still be influenced by a variety of factors like the digital asset's supply, the market's demand, the cost of producing it, the miners' rewards, regulations regarding the asset's sale and use, news developments, competing crypto, and so forth.Â How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin?Â The length it takes can vary depending on the block reward's amount (how much will crypto miners will receive for generating a new block).It is estimated that on average a new block is produced every 10 minutes, meaning that a new Bitcoin gets mined approximately every 1.6 minutes.Â Is mining Bitcoin illegal?Â The legality of this process will most likely solely depend on your geographic location.Â As Bitcoin threatens fiat currencies' dominance and governmental control, the digital asset has been declared to be completely illegal in some countries.Â With that being said, ownership and the coin's mining process are still legal in many more countries than not.Â  While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.Â No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.Â In fact, we've gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo HanyeczÂ made BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John's.One could now argue that Bitcoin has now a global brand because of how everyone recognizes it even if they don't really know what it is.Added to that, Bitcoin also has the largest market cap and liquidity pool which is why many find it to be the most attractive coin out there.Â Bitcoin summed upÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating with no type of central control nor oversight from banks or governments, relying solely on its cryptography and peer-to-peer software.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â A public ledger keeps track of all transactions by recording them.

Now, a report from the World Gold Council, a U.K-based market development organization for the gold industry, attempts to pour cold water on this notion, with evidence that bitcoin had a chance to stamp itself as the new gold â and failed. 'In Q4 2018, as global stock markets experienced their worst quarter since 2009, cryptocurrencies had a prime opportunity to demonstrate qualities associated with havens like gold. However, cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, behaved like risky assets and fell while gold rallied,' the report said.

The twins argue that bitcoin's fungibility and divisibility â thanks to its fixed and known supply â make it a better bet than gold.

'The fourth quarter offered just one data point for bitcoin analysis, but it was an important one,' they said. 'This was one of the few periods during which true market stress has occurred since the financial crisis. And it should lead investors to reassess their reasons for investing in cryptocurrencies.'",marketwatch.com,274,news,US,en,Aaron Hankin,https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-FX802_bitcoi_ZG_20171106164656.jpg,False,@marketwatch,12.687449,66afccd1029df933c0415a09920fd663
Estate Planning With Bitcoin Explained,,2019-01-25 18:01:32,full,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/estate-planning/estate-planning-bitcoin-explained,wealthmanagement.com,Planning for the currency of the future should start today.,"By Robert D. Kaplow, Esq.Â  So your client bought some type of cryptocurrency (bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc.). He hopes that the value will skyrocket and represent a sizable portion of his estate. If that dream comes to pass, how do you handle those bitcoins for estate planning purposes? (For purposes of this article, all cryptocurrencies will be referred to as bitcoin.) One of the major selling points for purchasing bitcoins is its anonymity. There is no paper trail, and there are no physical assets to touch. However, this becomes a major problem when your client dies. How does his family access the bitcoins? Do they even know that he owns bitcoins? Transparency and disclosure are key! Your client needs to inform his advisors and his family that he owns bitcoins so they can act appropriately. More important, he needs to make sure that his bitcoins can be accessed in the event of his disability or death. Bitcoins are accessed through the use of a 'private key'âeffectively a password. Bitcoin users store the private keys in 'wallets.' Wallets are generally stored online. Once someone has access to the wallet, the bitcoins can be purchased, sold or transferred. Thus, it is important that your client's personal representative (executor), trustee or trusted family member has access to the private key. Don't lose track of the private key or the hard drive that contains it. There are numerous stories (probably some of them apocryphal) of people losing millions of dollars by selling their computers only to later remember that the hard drives had their private keys. (This also happened to Leonard in an episode of The Big Bang Theory.) It is our suggestion that you encourage clients to prepare a detailed letterâto be kept in a safe deposit box or other secure locationâindicating any private keys and bitcoin transactions. This letter needs to be updated periodically. The letter should also provide detailed instructions on how to access the bitcoins, including any passwords or codes needed to take custody of the bitcoins. It is also our suggestion that your client's bitcoin holdings be transferred to a revocable living trust. This will avoid the necessity for having to go to probate court to transfer the bitcoins on his death. While we generally refer to bitcoins as 'currency,' the Internal Revenue Service held in Notice 2014-21 that bitcoins are property, not currency. The tax implications of this ruling are that you have gain or loss on the sale or transfer of bitcoins and must maintain records to show your tax basis in bitcoins. For example, if your client used $2,000 of bitcoins to purchase a television and the bitcoins cost you $500, you have a gain of $1,500 that needs to be reported on your income tax return. While bitcoins may be the currency of the future, it is imperative that your clients take the necessary steps today to ensure their families can access the bitcoins on the clients' death. Robert D. Kaplow is a shareholder at Maddin Hauser law firm based in Southfield, Mich.

Lee's Jan. 6 post argued that:'Some self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists are actually Bitcoin Extremists. They think all other coins are scams and will go to zero. Maximalists think Bitcoin is and will remain the dominant cryptocurrency but there is room for altcoins to exist and even do well.'Lee also opened a Twitter survey, which has drawn over 24,300 votes as of press time and is due to expire in 6 hours, inviting users to identify as either a 'Bitcoin Extremist,' 'Bitcoin Maximalist,' 'Altcoin Maximalist,' or 'Nocoiner.' At press time, 9 percent have identified as Bitcoin 'extremists,' 48 percent as Bitcoin 'maximalists,' 32 percent as altcoin 'maximalists,' and 11 percent as 'nocoiners.'Lee's remarks provoked a series of quick-witted responses â both dissenting and affirmative â Â including one from crypto industry figure Jameson Lopp, who quipped, 'Bitcoin Supremacists, please. Extremists has a negative connotation,' adding 'I identify as a Segregated Witness.'Mindful of Lee's provocation, Ragnar Lifthrasir, founder of the International Blockchain Real Estate Association (IBREA), told Lee he was on 'the path to wrong-think,' and that using the jargon of extremism was little more than a smear of anyone whose 'opinion differs from Charlie's.'Lee's comments also provoked debates over whether Bitcoin 'maximalism,' is little more than a marketing term allegedly coined by altcoin founders, as well as over Bitcoin's prevailing brand dominance. Some commentators responded â Â without proclaiming any allegiances â that ultimately it will be the free market and tangible use cases that will separate the successful projects in a sector of proliferating cryptocurrencies.As of press time, the share of Bitcoin's market capitalization in the overall crypto market cap is at 51.8 percent, according to CoinMarketCap data.On the cusp of the new year, tokenization protocol Stellar's co-founder and CTO Jed McCaleb â who is also one of the founders of now-defunct Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt.

Paying taxes with Bitcoin is becoming a reality,Kari Paul,2019-01-07 20:00:00,full,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/believe-it-or-not-some-americans-already-pay-their-bitcoin-in-taxes-2019-01-07?mod=personal-finance,marketwatch.com,"Overstock will become the first company in the US to pay its taxes in bitcoin.

The online retailer will take advantage of a program in Ohio, announced in November, to pay a portion of its taxes using the cryptocurrency. Overstock was an early adopter of bitcoin becoming one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin for payment on its site in 2014.
Overstock chief executive officer and founder Patrick M. Byrne said in a statement that 'thoughtful government adoption of emerging technologies when accompanied by non-restrictive legislation over these technologies' is the best way forward for the US and other advanced economies.
The plan may sound like a gimmick, but it could actually be a money-saver for businesses in the crypto space, said Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Washington, DC-based cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center.
The same goes for people looking to pay their personal income taxes with cryptocurrency, which is also allowed in Ohio. 'This would be good idea for a business that already has a lot of bitcoin as it saves them the step of converting their bitcoin to dollars before paying taxes,' he said. 'Now they will just be converted right at the moment of payment.'
As with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes. In other words, you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes.
While this may sound like a headache, it can actually help people who have lost money in bitcoin's volatile year, said Farrukh Shaikh, chief financial officer and co-founder of Gath3r, a cryptocurrency mining service.
If the current bitcoin price is higher than the price you originally paid, then you would have to pay extra tax on the now realized gain from the bitcoin payment. However, if the current bitcoin price is lower than your basis price, then it amounts to realizing a loss on the bitcoin, which can be offset against your total tax bill and reduce it.
'Using bitcoin to pay taxes may be attractive to people who are currently at a loss from their bitcoin entry price if they want to reduce their bitcoin holdings and pay taxes around the same time,' he said.
Bitcoin fell from highs of nearly $20,000 per coin in December 2017 to 10 consecutive sessions below $4,000 in late 2018.
The Internal Revenue Service hasn't released a detailed policy on how to go about paying taxes using cryptocurrency, besides a ruling in 2014 stating that selling bitcoin is treated the same as selling property or any other capital asset. People must report each transaction in terms of whether it was a loss or again, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies.
Experts suggest filing taxes with a Certified Public Accountant, particularly one with cryptocurrency expertise if you have done business in bitcoin in the past year. Thus far, Ohio is the first and only state to accept bitcoin payments for taxes.
Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel told Bitcoin magazine the state wanted to show it is on the forefront of new technology by announcing the new tax policy by announcing Ohiocrypto.com.
'We wanted to project to the rest of the country that Ohio is embracing technology and is a place that is welcoming software developers and entrepreneurs who want to build a blockchain business here in the state of Ohio,' he said.",nypost.com,274,news,US,en,"Kari Paul,Marketwatch",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/bitcoin-south-america.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,False,@nypost,12.6687765,05a5c3dc566f35bdd4a3ec0edb2c45db
Coinbase Has Still Not Issued Bitcoin SV to Customers,P. H. Madore,2019-01-04 10:24:24,full,https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-has-still-not-issued-bitcoin-sv-to-customers,ccn.com,Read the story Coinbase Has Still Not Issued Bitcoin SV to Customers posted in our category on CCN.com here.,"Coinbase has yet to give Bitcoin Cash holders their Bitcoin SV from the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that happened November 15th 2018.

The fork away from Bitcoin Cash by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre's preferred chain, called Bitcoin SV or 'Satoshi's Vision,' happened November 15th. The hash war was widely reported in CCN.com and elsewhere. The result was two forks of Bitcoin Cash. Just like the original Bitcoin Cash hard fork, this meant users who had money on the Bitcoin Cash chain would now by right have money on the Bitcoin SV chain.

Poloniex by Circle Had a Pre-Fork Solution

Poloniex led the way and allowed both pre-fork trading and a convenient way for users to be sure their coins would 'split' properly. All one had to do was make a deposit to their Bitcoin Cash wallet prior to the fork. Poloniex would take care of the rest. Many used this as an opportunity to initially 'dump' their Bitcoin SV, even before it was officially live on its own blockchain.

The 'hash war' that ensued resulted in Bitcoin ABC and Roger Ver retaining control of the 'BCH' (Bitcoin Cash) ticker on the majority of exchanges. Calvin Ayre eventually called for a 'cease-fire,' demanding that neither chain claim the previously unified mantle. Bitcoin ABC did not agree to this. The result is that exchanges which list both tokens now have BCH (Bitcoin ABC), which is the dominant fork of the original Bitcoin Cash, and BSV, which is Bitcoin SV.

Coinbase users who were holding Bitcoin Cash at the time of the fork are entitled to Bitcoin SV, just as those who were holding Bitcoin at the time of the original Bitcoin Cash hard fork were entitled to Bitcoin Cash.

User Repeatedly Requests His Bitcoin SV And Is Stonewalled By Coinbase

However, as an exasperated user wrote to CCN.com, Coinbase has yet to release Bitcoin SV to anyone.

Across multiple e-mails over a few weeks, Coinbase assures the user, who will remain anonymous, that he will receive his Bitcoin SV, but will not provide any further details. They do mention that while they will allow withdrawals apparently whenever they feel like it, there will be no trading or deposits.

The week of Christmas, our informant responded to a reply from Coinbase on Christmas Eve:

I already read that generic update before I wrote you. Your team hasn't updated us for 5 weeks since then. It is about time for a further update. Please provide something better than just rehashing what you already have on your website, we deserve better.

To this, Coinbase said:

Thanks for contacting Coinbase Support. I understand the importance of your digital currency and thank you for your patience with us. I've taken a look at your case and am working with a specialist to address your issue properly. Please note that these reviews are typically completed within 5-7 business days. Thanks again for your understanding.

The same day, Coinbase said:

Following the BCH hard fork and conclusion of the hash war, Bitcoin SV has confirmed the creation of a new coin, BSV. Coinbase intends to allow customers to withdraw BSV at a future date, though we do not currently intend to support trading, buys or sells. We will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.

Our frustrated informant wrote back on the 28th of December:

It's already been 7 WEEKS since that last update. 'We will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.' â so I think that I am entitled to an additional update. You have been busy adding new trading pairs, but cannot ensure that coins that your clients own can be given to them for them to use. That is unacceptable. Please escalate this to someone whom can provide a better answer.

Then, earlier this week, on the 2nd of January, Coinbase finally gave an answer with some substance:

I understand your frustration and I wish that there was more that I could do. However, we will provide additional updates as they are available. We anticipate development work for BSV withdrawals will take at least a few weeks, but may take longer.

Notice how Coinbase repeats themselves after the user complains that he already had this information.

Will Coinbase Users Ever Realize Gains from Bitcoin SV Fork?

Meanwhile, users of other wallet services and exchanges have had their BSV for weeks, and were even able to cash out at the all-time high of over $200. At time of writing, Bitcoin SV was trading just under $90.

It would seem that, given the high volume of users Coinbase has (over 10 million), the overall Bitcoin SV market has yet to fully discover its price if hundreds of thousands (potentially) Bitcoin SV coins have been locked away in Coinbase's custody.

Reddit users have also been wondering for some time when they will receive their BSV.

Since then the cryptocurrency has been on a wild ride, surviving massive price swings, hackings and intense global scrutiny. Bitcoin's ups and downs have helped the asset go from a little-understood concept to a household name.

""Over the last 10 years we've gone from this didn't exist to now pretty much the entire world understands what it is, whether they agree with it or not,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, told CNBC on Friday.

CNBC takes a look at bitcoin's tumultuous price history over the last decade.

2009

The first bitcoins were mined in a block of 50 coins called ""Genesis Block"" on January 3, 2009. The act of mining bitcoins entails computers trying to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. Computers compete to verify a group of transactions known as a ""block."" The computer, or miner, that can validate the block the fastest receives a reward in bitcoins.

The concept of bitcoin, and its underlying blockchain technology, was laid out in a white paper published in October 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains a mystery today. Nakamoto envisioned bitcoin as an alternative form of electronic cash that would not require the backing of the government or a financial institution.

The first-ever bitcoin transaction took place on January 9, 2009 between Nakamoto and software developer Hal Finney.

2010

It's widely believed the first real-world bitcoin transaction was made in May 2010 by programmer Laszlo Hanyecz. Hanyecz spent 10,000 bitcoins on two Papa John's pizzas; those pizzas would now be worth more than $30 million at today's bitcoin price.

Bitcoin gained public attention later in 2010 with the creation of an exchange called Mt. Gox. The Tokyo-based exchange allowed investors to trade bitcoin, which was priced around $0.07 per coin for most of that year, according to CoinDesk.

2011

2013

Bitcoin topped $1,000 for the first time in November 2013 but the spike didn't last long. The cryptocurrency would close the year trading at around $700, according to data from CoinDesk.

2014

Mt. Gox, which handled roughly 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions, declared bankruptcy after hackers stole roughly half a billion dollars worth of coins. The hacking exposed the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency and scared away many investors. By the end of 2014, the price of bitcoin barely breached $300, a level where it would stay for the next three years.

2017

Bitcoin momentum started to build in early 2017, when the price of a coin again crossed $1,000. More investors bought into the idea of a decentralized currency, seeking a safe-haven investment similar to gold.

To meet growing demand, two U.S. exchanges, the CME and Cboe, created platforms for customers to trade bitcoin futures.

As the cryptocurrency went mainstream, frenzy ensued. Bitcoin's price surged from around $2000 in July to nearly $20,000 in December.

2018

Bitcoin's price dropped from sky-high levels to kick off 2018 as investors fretted the bubble was bursting. Regulators around the world started to crack down on cryptocurrency trading, causing particularly volatile price swings.

Many hedge funds, retail investors and traders who had bet big on bitcoin took heavy losses as the digital asset's price plummeted, closing the end of the year at around $4,000.

What is a bubble?

2019

""The last 10 years for Bitcoin, whilst broadly telling a hugely successful story, has also not been without difficulty,"" wrote David Thomas co-founder of London-based cryptocurrency exchange GlobalBlock in an email to CNBC on Wednesday.

Bitcoin bulls say a comeback is due but retail investors might not want to stomach continued volatility. Regulatory uncertainty is likely to remain one key factor in bitcoin trading this year.

""If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then Bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right,"" added Thomas.",cnbc.com,128,news,US,en,"Elizabeth Schulze,https://www.facebook.com/CNBC",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105460661-1537410148622gettyimages-1035974112.jpeg?v=1609909817&w=1920&h=1080,False,@CNBC,12.668236,f5babba288f54e858c8e3d63315fd40d

An examination of the available 500+ days worth of data on the bitcoin cash blockchain shows that despite the impassioned arguments and big promises made about its 8 MB block size, it has never come close to filling out this capacity.

Data from Coinmetrics shows that Bitcoin Cash still remains far behind Bitcoin not only in proportional terms but also in absolute terms as both miners and consumers have overwhelmingly chosen to remain with Bitcoin. Notwithstanding a couple of brief spikes, the market has delivered its verdict over the course of 17 months.

Bitcoin Remains King

Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash Block Size Comparison | Source: Coinmetrics

It would seem that the Bitcoin Cash fork which took place in the midst of a polarising argument about whether or not to maintain bitcoin's 1 MB block size has turned out to be an exercise in futility. While the major idea behind Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was purportedly to provide a faster and easier way for transactions to be made using a larger block size as a solution, the market has spoken in the intervening year and a half, and what it has to say is not good news for Bitcoin Cash.

The data shows that far from filling out or even getting anywhere close to its 8 MB block size, BCH has averaged a block size of merely 171 KB since the August 2017 fork. Bitcoin, by comparison, has averaged about 934 KB of its 1 MB block capacity over the past month. In other words, BCH is utilizing just about 2.1 percent of its block capacity and is only averaging about 18 percent of Bitcoin's block size despite having forked with the express intention of building bigger blocks. Despite any protestations to the contrary, this clearly shows that there is a significant lack of interest in Bitcoin Cash, as has been the case with Bitcoin forks in general.

So far, there has only been a single day on record that has seen BCH block size utilization rise about 50 percent. This took place on January 9, 2018, when BCH block sizes briefly hit 59 percent of the 8 MB capacity before rapidly reverting to mean. Even more tellingly from a market point of view, bitcoin cash has hardly fared any better in terms of investment, managing only about 3.6 percent of the market cap of its ancestor.

"ElectrumSV Wallet Released for Bitcoin SV (BSV), the Original Bitcoin",,2019-01-11 11:15:00,timezone unknown,https://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2019/01/11/8880376.htm,tmcnet.com,"LONDON, January 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The bComm Association announces the ElectrumSV wallet for Bitcoin SV (BSV), the rebirth of the original Bitcoin. ElectrumSV is a conversion - for the Bitcoinâ¦","LONDON, January 11, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --
The bComm Association announces the ElectrumSV wallet for Bitcoin SV (BSV), the rebirth of the original Bitcoin. ElectrumSV is a conversion - for the Bitcoin SV blockchain - of the popular Electrum wallet for Bitcoin. ElectrumSV version 1.0.0 is available at electrumsv.io and is provided for free usage under the open source MIT license.
Â Â Â Â  (Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/807147/ElectrumSV_Wallet_Logo.jpg )

The original Electrum wallet was created for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain, and is considered one of the top Bitcoin wallets because of its strong technical feature set. After the August 2017 hard fork which created Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a BCH version of Electrum was created under the name ""Electron Cash"".
More recently, the November 15, 2018 hard fork of BCH led to BSV emerging as its own chain and token, dedicated to preserve Bitcoin's original design.Â Named for the ""Satoshi Vision"" of Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV's mission is focused: Â restore the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale. Â 
This led developers Roger Taylor and Neil Booth to create a new version of the Electrum wallet dedicated to BSV. Roger and Neil were wo productive developers of the Electron Cash version of Electrum. Neil also created the ElectrumX Â server software which is used almost exclusively by all Electrum-based wallets. However, finding no future on the Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH/BAB) chain, they decided to create and release the ElectrumSV wallet for the BSV chain. As they explain on the ElectrumSV.io website: "" Bitcoin SVÂ is the only Bitcoin that followsÂ the whitepaperÂ and values being stable and non-experimental, ElectrumSV naturally builds on it."" ElectrumSV will focus on being a desktop wallet, leaving mobile wallet development to other BSV ventures such as Centbee, HandCash and Cashpay.Â Because it based on both the Electrum and Electron Cash wallets, the ElectrumSV feature set includes:

an advanced interface allowing flexible importing of private keys from other wallets;
integration with hardware wallets such as Bitbox, Ledger and Keepkey; and
management of wallet keys and historical transactions.Â 

Given their more advanced feature set, the Electrum family of wallets (including Electron Cash) are known to be more suited to developers than consumer users. The ElectrumSV team intends to keep and extend the advanced feature set and flexible functionality inherited from Electrum, but will improve functions to be more user-friendly for the ordinary Bitcoin consumer. Â  Â 
ElectrumSV's user-friendly approach begins immediately with a key feature in the first release:Â a coin splitting tool to allow users to easily and safely split their pre-fork BCH coins into BSV coins. This addresses a common request from users since the November 2018 BCH hard fork which led to Bitcoin SV's emergence.
Roger Taylor and Neil Booth remark:
""We agree with the Bitcoin SV message that it's time for Bitcoin to grow up, keep a stable protocol without constant developer experimentation, and move to its next phase for scaling and mass adoption. Â ElectrumSV is contributing to that effort by leaving behind the developer-focused experience, and making a wallet with easy-to-use features for everyone. We intend to continue making more improvements for the future.""
Work on the ElectrumSV project is supported by the bComm Association, the first-ever organization dedicated to bCommerce (Bitcoin commerce) which brings together developers, merchants, exchanges, miners and other Bitcoin network participants. The bComm Association supports Bitcoin SV as the only stable, scalable blockchain that can achieve a world of bCommerce.
nChain, the blockchain research & development firm, and its Bitcoin SV Node team also assisted the ElectrumSV developers. nChain's Jimmy Nguyen, Founding President of the bComm Association, remarks:
""We are thrilled to help Roger and Neil bring the strong legacy of the Electrum wallet to Bitcoin SV. The ElectrumSV team understands that Bitcoin is for everyone, not just for developers.Â That is why their approach to upgrade Electrum into a more user-friendly wallet for BSV is critical to help achieve the Satoshi Vision - a world where billions of people globally use Bitcoin every day.""

This is commonly referred to as Blockchain.,"Bitcoin has been called a lot of things.

Fans of the cryptocurrency see it as the future of money, convinced that it's on track to shake up the world of global finance.

For others, it is met with great skepticism, and understandably so. For a lot of people, it is often associated with the dark web and with it, assumptions of criminal activity. For the average person, the subject of cryptocurrency is filled with technical and financial jargon. This often exacerbates peoples skepticism, especially when you have little to no knowledge of the basics.

One undeniable fact about Bitcoin is that it has been everywhere. Regardless of how well-versed you are in crypto-speak, no one has been able to escape talk of Bitcoin since 2017. It was in this year that Bitcoin's value peaked at $20,000 value which lead to a endless discussion and debate in the press and media.

Cybercrime solicitors Cartwright King, have compiled an easy to follow infographic, guiding you through all you really need to know to understand Bitcoin.

What Exactly is Bitcoin?

The thought of a solely virtual currency might sound like a difficult concept to grasp, but this is the beauty of Bitcoin. Bitcoins are essentially bits of computer code. These codes represent monetary units of value.

The prices aren't controlled by countries or banks- it's set by the open market. It is simply controlled by what people are willing to buy and sell them for.

Bitcoin's Humble(ish) Beginnings:

Bitcoin has been around over 10 years now, and it's definitely taken an interesting
evolution since then.

The original Bitcoin domain was first registered in 2008. Following the movement's unveiling in a white paper outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto (an unrevealed pseudonym created for a person or group of people involved), it was described as 'a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.'

By 2009, the first batch of the cryptocurrency was officially issued. At this point, Bitcoin officially had an online presence and network. Just 50 Bitcoins were released every 10 minutes. At the time, they were free to participants who were willing to help update and maintain the Bitcoin ledger. This is commonly referred to as Blockchain.

So, to keep this as simple as possible â anyone who wanted free Bitcoins had to maintain the ledger. This would be done by processing any recent transactions. Processing these transactions would then generate a brand new Bitcoin code, which participants competed to solve, in a process known as âmining'. The first person to process and certify all the transactions in one âblock' then won the Bitcoins.

The users of Bitcoin were free to do what they pleased with the coins. They could distribute them to other users who had a Bitcoin address, or they could keep them for themselves. Luckily for them, distributing bundles of Bitcoins at the time was free of charge. Now, it could cost upwards of thousands of dollars!

What is Mining?

In its simplest form, mining is the process of obtaining cryptocurrency. Without miners processing and storing transactions on the blockchain, Bitcoin would not be in operation.

Anyone who's registered to Bitcoin can 'mine'- but what is the process?

Here are the steps to 'mining' successfully:

Step 1: Initiating transaction- someone buys something or sends money to someone
Step 2: The transaction is bundled with others in what is known as a block. This block then forms part of a 'blockchain.'
Step 3: Everyone in the bitcoin network gets an alert.
Step 4: People in the network must approve the transaction for it to be valid.
Step 5: The header from the old block gets inserted into a new block, which then becomes a large piece of code. This is called the 'hash algorithm'.
Step 6: People registered to the Bitcoin ledger then have the chance to solve the algorithm.
Step 7: Whoever solves it first gets awarded Bitcoins, and the original transaction continues.
Step 8: This block now gets added to a blockchain
Step 9: The money gets processed.

With the right set up â all this can be done in just a few seconds!

There are currently 11 million Bitcoins in circulation, and once they hit their projected target of 21 million by 2140, no more of these will be released. Currently, Bitcoin is accepted as a legitimate form of currency across thousands of companies. With such a piqued interest, the Bitcoin craze will only further revolutionse the way we spend our money.",valuewalk.com,5545,news,US,en,"A Popular Value Investing,Email,Four Kids In Passaic Nj.,Full Disclosure,Jacob At Www.Valuewalk.Com,Jacob Wolinsky,Jacobwolinsky,Twitter Username",https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitcoin-Basics.jpg,False,@valuewalk,12.652247,190ba8d9f1f8da6292d96213e760e459
No to Bitcoin Cash: OpenNode Rejects Roger Ver's $1.25m Fund Offer,Yashu Gola,2019-01-01 08:00:14,full,https://www.ccn.com/no-to-bitcoin-cash-opennode-rejects-roger-vers-1-25m-fund-offer,ccn.com,Bitcoin payment processing startup OpenNode has rejected a $1.5 million investment gesture made by Roger Ver.,"Bitcoin payment processing startup OpenNode has rejected a $1.5 million investment gesture made by Roger Ver.

The company, which exclusively supports the Bitcoin payment protocol, confirmed that its vision of a better and more open financial system could not be achieved with Bitcoin Cash, adding that it would spend 100% of its resources on Bitcoin and its second-layer payment solutions instead.

OpenNode aims to process bitcoin transactions in real-time to boost the digital currency's adoption among enterprises and businesses. It supports Lightning Network, a second-layer payment protocol launched to confirm Bitcoin transactions away from the main chain. The efforts led OpenNode to raise $1.5 million in seed funding from investor Tim Draper.

Accept Bitcoin Cash and Take $1.5 Million

Ver, who believes that Lightning Network is an inferior solution to solve Bitcoin's scalability issues, attempted to match Draper's bid. He confirmed that he would invest $1.5 million into the OpenNode project if they readily accept Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin as their only payment processing protocol. Excerpts from his statement:

'I don't need one share whatsoever [for my investment]. All I require is [OpenNode] to work on payment processing of Bitcoin Cash, the version of Bitcoin that can actually scale to become the money for the world.'

Ver predicted â through a Moore Law-enabled algorithm â that it would take close to two centuries for the world to board the Lightning Network solution. But in the case of Bitcoin Cash, the time would reduce to just shy of 50 years.

'Bitcoin cannot become the money for the world in a reasonable amount of time with its block size limited to 1 megabyte to 4 megabytes,' he added. 'Even with Schnorr's signature, you are still looking at far more time for BTC to be ready for the world than you are with Bitcoin Cash thanks to Moore's Laws.'

The community was quick to respond to Ver's claims against Bitcoin, with many bashing him for twisting mathematics to suit his agenda. CryptoTesla on Twitter argued that the Bitcoin Cash CEO was ignoring the fact that Bitcoin could scale in the next 100 years while being progressive about his project.

'Have these people never heard of Moore's Law? On top of this, he assumes BTC will never have a Block Size increase in over 100 years? In summary: his numbers for BTC have no progress in them while his numbers for BCH have more progress than the growth we saw last decade.'

Speculation about Moscow's plans to become a huge cryptocurrency investor has sparked hopes that 2019 will be the year in which Bitcoin recovers from its disastrous collapse in value. 
However, both Russia and the crypto world are known to be filled withÂ smoke and mirrors so there's no way of telling whether Putin really is planning to become a Bitcoin mega-investor.
The rumours started on the back of an article on an Australian cryptocurrency website called Micky, which spoke to a Russian economist and cryptocurrency expert who predicted his country would start to invest in Bitcoin.

âUS sanctions may be mitigated only through Bitcoin use,' the Russian is quoted as saying.
âBecause of US sanctions, Russia's elite is forced to dump US assets and US dollars and invest hugely into Bitcoins.
âThe Central Bank of Russia sits on $466 billion of reserves and has to diversify in case there are limited opportunities to do it in the future.'
Of course, this is not a cast-iron guarantee that Russia really will start to invest in Bitcoin.
But if it does pump billions into the virtual market, you can expect price rises to be fast and dramatic.
The past year has been dismal for Bitcoin. At the end of 2017, one coin was worth a whopping $20,000 but it's now worth just over $3.600.

Bitpay CCO Sonny Singh has stated that the $20,000 bitcoin price at the back-end of 2017 and the price fluctuations throughout 2018 were a bit of 'an anomaly'. He also agrees that bitcoin demand and usage were at a low last year and although crypto volatility has been a continuing trend into the new year, prices could still steadily rise over the course of 2019.

Singh made the statements when talking to Bloomberg in regards to the future of bitcoin after its sudden stumble in the final quarter of 2018.

Bitcoin was Not a Hedge Against Falling Stock Prices

The lively conversation on the Bloomberg Technology show with Bloomberg Opinion's Stephen Gandel and the Bitpay chief commercial officer Sonny Singh brought up some interesting points on both sides of the bitcoin argument.

The discussion started with Gandel talking about the defining factors that have contributed to not only the massive drop in bitcoin prices from the end of 2017 but also the recent drop to below $4,000 in November 2018. Gandel went in hard on bitcoin by saying:

It's been a terrible week for bitcoin. A huge breaking thing is that there is this concept that bitcoin was some kind of port in a storm. That it would be a safer asset because inflation would hurt the dollar and stocks. But we didn't see that. Damage is one of the main reasons people were buying it for an investment.

He went on to suggest that when stock prices fell, bitcoin fell because the two are intrinsically connected. He mentioned that this was the reason why people were buying bitcoin to hedge against falling stock prices, but it didn't hold its value as expected.

Bitpay CCO Defends Bitcoin on Bloomberg

In response to Gandel's thoughts on the matter, Sonny Singh suggested that the overall state of the crypto industry is still healthy despite the problems in 2018. He talked about how a lot of new businesses in 2018 were built around bitcoin remaining around the $10,000 mark. However, he is still 'long-term bullish' on bitcoin prices moving into 2019.

Story continues

Singh went on to point out that major companies such as Fidelity and Goldman Sachs are still launching their crypto products. He also talked about how an increase in regulations shows that the crypto industry is readying itself for wider adoption so the long term philosophy of bitcoin is still sound.

When pressed on the issue of lower usage of bitcoin in purchasing and other consumer-based areas in 2018, Sonny Singh conceded by saying that:

Everything built last year was a little overvalued and overhyped. Yet usage is now starting to catch up a little bit, but again new products are launching. Last year was a total anomaly, but I think you are going to see how these new products launch.

Singh talked about how hype was a main component of the massive price increases at the $20,00 mark and was not based on fundamentals. The idea was that banks would soon be integrating blockchain into their systems and how everyone thought it was about to take off. But in reality, nothing much happened and we came to realize that greater adoption is still 'further down the road.'

Cryptocurrency Firm Bitwise Asset Management Seeks SEC Review of New Bitcoin ETF,,2019-01-15 23:00:00,timezone unknown,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cryptocurrency-firm-bitwise-asset-58405,jdsupra.com,"According to an initial registration statement published on January 10, the cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has applied...","According to an initial registration statement published on January 10, the cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') to form a new bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund ('ETF'). The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust seeks approval to issue and redeem shares that trade on the NYSE Arca, Inc. stock exchange in blocks of 25,000 shares. If approved, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust will be the first of its kind.

Bitwise Asset Management's SEC Form S-1 states that the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust will track the performance of the total returns available to investors in bitcoin, as measured by the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index.[1] The ETF will invest substantially all of its assets in bitcoin traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.[2] In a press release, Bitwise Asset Management stated that the proposed ETF differs from previously filed bitcoin ETFs in that it will rely on regulated third-party custodians to hold the physical bitcoins.[3]

Despite growing public demand, the SEC has yet to grant an application to list a bitcoin-backed ETF. Previously rejected applications include that of Bats BZX Exchange, Inc. (BZX), which sought to list and trade shares of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.

In a July 2018 order rejecting BZX's application, the SEC concluded that the proposed cryptocurrency-based ETF conflicted with Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.[4] The provision requires, in relevant part, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed 'to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices' and 'to protect investors and the public interest.'[5] The SEC explained that BZX must demonstrate an ability to reach a surveillance-sharing agreement with 'a regulated, bitcoin-related market of significant size' in order to carry its burden of establishing compliance with the Securities Exchange Act.[6] BZX failed to carry this burden because its proposal did not support a finding that the markets for bitcoin and derivatives of bitcoin are significant or regulated.[7] At this time, the SEC has yet to set forth parameters regarding the scope of the term 'significant market.'

In a press release, Bitwise Asset Management expressed optimism that the SEC will reach a different conclusion with respect to the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust. A representative stated that the firm spent 2018 researching the SEC's concerns regarding the 'quality of the crypto trading ecosystem, the reliability of crypto pricing, the strength of the arbitrage function in crypto, and the robustness of crypto custody.'[8] Based on its research, Bitwise Asset Management now believes it can provide the SEC with sufficient information to address these concerns.

An application by SolidX, VanEck, and CBOE to list an ETF known the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on the NYSE also remains pending before the SEC.

By CCN.com: Bitcoin Cash posted the most gains out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Ethereum lost nearly 2%, XRP and Bitcoin over 1%, and Bitcoin SV continues to threaten an exit from the top 10. Thus is the state of the crypto market on late Wednesday afternoon.

Bitcoin Price Slips Toward $3,500

In yesterday's market round-up, we reported that Bitcoin had risen almost 1% over the 24-hour period. Over the past day, however, the grandfather crypto has lost that near 1% and dropped by around 1.10%. A daily high of almost $3,670 led to a price at press time of $3,595. Bitcoin may be walking down the steps to its notable bottom of $3,100 or a bit lower.

Bitcoin traded within a comfortable (for crypto) range of $80 over the day, with a high of almost $3,670 and a press-time price of $3,595.[/caption]

The True Strength Indicator on Bitcoin was as low as -26, a sign that sell pressure is winning today. A sentimental cryptocurrency if there ever was one, negative sentiments expressed around Bitcoin at Davos are probably not helping matters in this bear market. CCN also notes that a 'zero' price figure for Bitcoin is virtually impossible.

It's been an exciting time for cryptocurrency followers. After a few months of relative stability during which bitcoin traded within a fairly narrow band, the price of the coin took a sudden dive. From a high of about $6,500 at the end of the first week of November, bitcoin fell to around $3,500 within the space of just two weeks. Just when we thought we were entering a whole new era for bitcoin in particular and cryptocurrency as a whole, we're back to the bad old days of the crypto rollercoaster. In one 24-hour period, the price of bitcoin managed to range from $3,448 to $4,101. This isn't the first time that bitcoin has given investors a sudden bumpy ride. The loss of nearly 50% of the coin's value is a soft fall compared to the 87% collapse from $1,141 to $152 between the end of November 2013 and mid-August 2015. Or the 83% collapse from $259 to $45 over two days in April 2013. Or the 94 % collapse from $31 to $2 over five months in 2011. Bitcoin recovered from each of those falls, and there's every reason to believe that a more mature bitcoin will recover from this one too.
But what happens then? What will bitcoin need most as it comes out of this collapse and enters a new era? What support should we be giving bitcoin to enable it and other cryptocurrencies to live up their potential? The first thing that bitcoin needs is stability â and bitcoin needs that stability more than any other digital coin. Where bitcoin leads, other coins follow. Once the first cryptocurrency begins to trade permanently within a narrow band, we'll soon start to see the other major coins following suit. Speculators will be able to punt on new coins generated by ICOs in the same way that stock traders buy penny stocks, but the rest of us can be content with the holdings of a digital currency that we bought years ago at a discount.

What will bring that long-term stability might just be the current temporary instability. Where there's panic, there's always an opportunity. But much of the recent fall has been driven by speculators dumping their coins for a loss. Those buying them now will stick around. The sellers trying to limit their losses won't be back.
That's a good thing. Right now, the economy in general and digital businesses,Â in particular, need an international electronic coin free from the control of national banks. They need people who are willing to hold through the dips instead of magnifying movements as they try to beat the markets. That means that digital businesses hoping to take bitcoin don't really need the arrival of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. Hedge funds and banks are welcome, of course. They'll add liquidity, and their presence gives cryptocurrency a vote of confidence. They show other investors that bitcoin is a safer bet than they might think. But those institutional investors are already here. Reports indicate that institutional investors have already replaced high net-worth individuals as the biggest buyers in transactions worth more than $100,000. They didn't bring stability. They came because of the stability.
Businesses need stability because what they really need is a return to the days when other merchants were willing to accept bitcoin, and customers were willing to spend them.
Those days pretty much ended last December when Steam announced that it would no longer accept bitcoin. Price volatility and high transaction costs pushed out a service provider that should really have been the ideal customer for an international digital coin.
But bitcoin was never meant to be an asset. It wasn't meant to make millionaires out of a handful of visionaries â and impose losses on everyone else who bought and sold at the wrong time. It was meant to make international transactions easier. It was meant to provide a way of buying and selling that couldn't be manipulated. It was meant to give the internet the financial service it has always lacked.
The need for that service still remains. Buyers and sellers still need a way to make transactions without paying the giant fees demanded by online payment services. Entrepreneurs who have built businesses online still need their own currency and control of their own financial futures. They need customers to have an easy way to buy bitcoin, keep it safe and spend it when they shop online wherever they choose to shop online.
The price of bitcoin itself doesn't matter. Bitcoin doesn't have to trade at $20,000 again. It doesn't need to hit six figures or to turn early entrants into millionaires, however nice that might be. Bitcoin just has to do what it was always supposed to do: ease financial transactions in a digital business environment.

The bComm Association unveils an updated logo for Bitcoin SV (ticker: BSV), chosen from public voting after three Twitter polls in a new form of decentralized marketing. The BSV logo is revealed on the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, to mark Bitcoin SV as rebirth of the original Bitcoin. A modernized update of the cryptocurrency's classic logo, the new design reflects Bitcoin SV's roots, while leading a new era for Bitcoin to professionalize.

(Logo:https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/803908/Bitcoin_SV_Logo.jpg)

Emerging from theNovember 15, 2018contentious hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, BSV is dedicated to preserve Bitcoin's original design.Named for the ""Satoshi Vision"" of Bitcoin's creatorSatoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV's mission is focused: restore the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.Unlike paths chosen by Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH/BAB), BSV's roadmap will achieve the world's new money used by billions of people, and the global public blockchain upon major enterprises can confidently build.

With modernized features, the new BSV logo conveys that Bitcoin is ready to grow up:

The B symbol is cleaner and stands upright rather than tilted forward or backward.

""Bitcoin SV"" characters also stand upright.

""Bitcoin"" begins with a capital B, rather than lower case.

""SV"" appears in superscript - reflecting Satoshi Vision as the way forward, while keeping emphasis on the name Bitcoin.

The design color uses ""dragon gold"", honouring the dragon logo of theBitcoin SVfull node implementation which birthed BSV.

This BSV logo was chosen after three Twitter polls of numerous design options developed by thebComm Association.The first-ever organization dedicated to bCommerce (Bitcoin commerce), the bComm Association brings together developers, merchants, exchanges, miners and other Bitcoin network participants.bComm Association supports Bitcoin SV as the only stable, scalable blockchain that can achieve a world of bCommerce.

nChain'sJimmy Nguyen, Founding President of the bComm Association, remarks:

""Todaymarks 10years since the birth of the Bitcoin blockchain, and this date has more importance now than ever. After too many years of wasteful diversions from the Satoshi Vision, we can now finally celebrate Bitcoin's rebirth - unchained from experimental whims of developer teams who veered away from Satoshi's original plan.The new BSV logo represents this pivotal moment for Bitcoin to grow up. In the spirit of Satoshi Vision, we are especially thrilled that BSV supporters around the world chose this logo after multiple rounds of online polling in a new paradigm of decentralized marketing.""

Though Bitcoin SV remains a decentralized cryptocurrency system, the bComm Association will now urge the global Bitcoin ecosystem to adopt this new logo for BSV.

Nguyen adds:

""TheBitcoin SV Nodeis now the reference implementation for the BSV protocol. To differentiate the full node implementation from the BSV cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin SV Node team atnChainintends to keep its dragon logo for the time being.Occupying the5th position in the Chinese zodiac, the dragon is the mightiest of the signs. It symbolizes leadership, ambition, good fortune, energy, and independence - perfect qualities for a reference implementation to lead Bitcoin to its destined world-changing future.""

In just over one month since emerging as a separate chain and token, the Bitcoin SV ecosystem has quickly grown. More than50 exchangesnow list BSV.Numerous walletshave announcedexclusivesupport for BSV - including the user-friendly and popularCashPay,Centbee,HandCash,hivr, andPixel Wallet.

For 2019, the bComm Association is dedicated to support technical efforts for massive on-chain scaling of the Bitcoin SV blockchain. BSV has already seen the world's largest blocks - 65 and 64MB - ever mined on a public blockchain. The bComm Association will work with theBCH Professional Stress Testteam, nChain and others to further test the BSV blockchain's throughput capacity, and demonstrate Satoshi Vision is the correct roadmap to much bigger blocks and big enterprise use.

How Bitcoin Works?
You can utilize Bitcoin for a wide range of genuine exchanges. To do so, you first purchase bitcoin anyway you like, either via credit card, a financial balance or even namelessly with money. At that point your bitcoins are moved straightforwardly into your Bitcoin wallet, and you can send and get installments specifically to a purchaser or dealer without the requirement for a normal go-between, for example, a bank or MasterCard organization.
Spending or accepting Bitcoin is as simple as sending an email, and you can utilize your PC or your mobile. That effortlessness misrepresents the way that there's a mess of convoluted math ensuring these exchanges to keep up their authenticity and security.
What Is Bitcoin Revolution And Does it Work?
After the descending pattern, which was strongly felt by each holder of the new computerized money, there has been the rise of what is currently called the Bitcoin Revolution. It is a specific device that is vital to estimating the market drifts in front of some other existing business sector structures so that there is no causing of misfortunes in essence. The revolution of bitcoin is aÂ gathering of go-betweensÂ that have the fundamental information about the Bitcoin framework and how it functions.

Regardless of whether you are active currently or not you don't need to be worried since you will have a straightforward assignment that shows your record.

There is no reason to worry because the system has already been tested and people all over the world are using it.

Cameron Winklevoss said in the chat, in which readers posted more than 250 questions and comments, and the brothers -- who run the Gemini Trust Co. exchange and are believed to still hold a large amount of Bitcoin -- answered some of them for over an hour. The questions ran the gamut from the twins' views of Bitcoin's future to recommendations for New York karaoke bars.

Some Americans already pay their taxes in bitcoin,Kari Paul,2019-01-09 16:30:00,full,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/believe-it-or-not-some-americans-already-pay-their-bitcoin-in-taxes-2019-01-07,marketwatch.com,One U.S. state is pushing the boundaries on the controversial cryptocurrency,"Overstock OSTK, +0.83% Â  will become the first company in the U.S. to pay its taxes in bitcoin.The online retailer will take advantage of a program in Ohio, announced in November, to pay a portion of its taxes using the cryptocurrency. Overstock was an early adopter of bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.53% Â  becoming one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin for payment on its site in 2014. Overstock chief executive officer and founder Patrick M. Byrne said in a statement that 'thoughtful government adoption of emerging technologies when accompanied by non-restrictive legislation over these technologies' is the best way forward for the U.S., and other advanced economies. The plan may sound like a gimmick, but it could actually be a money-saver for businesses in the crypto space, said Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Washington, D.C.-based cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center. 'This would be good idea for a business that already has a lot of bitcoin as it saves them the step of converting their bitcoin to dollars before paying taxes,' he said. 'Now they will just be converted right at the moment of payment.' The same goes for people looking to pay their personal income taxes with cryptocurrency, which is not currently allowed in Ohio but will be eventually in the second phase of the program, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel told Bitcoin magazine. 'In Phase II, we hope to expand Ohiocrypto.com to include individual personal taxes, and also to expand beyond just bitcoin and include other cryptocurrencies as well,' he said. 'We thought the most intuitive and responsible way to begin this initiative, because it's the first time it's ever been done in America, is to start it off right â and that is by only allowing businesses to pay with bitcoin, and expand it out from there.' 'As with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes, so you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes. ' As with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes. In other words, you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes. While this may sound like a headache, it can actually help people who have lost money in bitcoin's volatile year, said Farrukh Shaikh, chief financial officer and cofounder of Gath3r, a cryptocurrency mining service. If the current bitcoin price is higher than the price you originally paid, then you would have to pay extra tax on the now realized gain from the bitcoin payment. However, if the current bitcoin price is lower than your basis price, then it amounts to realizing a loss on the bitcoin, which can be offset against your total tax bill and reduce it. 'Using bitcoin to pay taxes may be attractive to people who are currently at a loss from their bitcoin entry price if they want to reduce their bitcoin holdings and pay taxes around the same time,' he said. 'People must report whether each transaction was a loss or a gain, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies.' Bitcoin fell from highs of nearly $20,000 per coin in December 2017 to 10 consecutive sessions below $4,000 in late 2018. The Internal Revenue Service hasn't released a detailed policy on how to go about paying taxes using cryptocurrency, besides a ruling in 2014 stating that selling bitcoin is treated the same as selling property or any other capital asset. People must report each transaction in terms of whether it was a loss or a gain, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Experts suggest filing taxes with a Certified Public Accountant, particularly one with cryptocurrency expertise, if you have done business in bitcoin in the past year. Thus far, Ohio is the first and only state to accept bitcoin payments from businesses for taxes. Mandel said the state wanted to show it is on the forefront of new technology by announcing the new tax policy by announcing Ohiocrypto.com. 'We wanted to project to the rest of the country that Ohio is embracing technology and is a place that is welcoming software developers and entrepreneurs who want to build a blockchain business here in the state of Ohio,' he said.",marketwatch.com,274,news,US,en,Kari Paul,https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-GC801_bitcoi_ZG_20180131140519.jpg,False,@marketwatch,12.615945,27f9660b354b01b67609188ab629d4e1

"Number of Bitcoin ATMs Hits 4,000 Globally: Why is it Growing So Rapidly?",Joseph Young,2019-01-21 11:40:23,full,https://news.yahoo.com/number-bitcoin-atms-hits-4-114023146.html,yahoo.com,"By CCN.com: According to a report released by ValueWalk, the number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has surpassed 4,000 and the market is still growing rapidly. The increase in the number of Bitcoin ATMsâ¦","By CCN.com: According to a report released by ValueWalk, the number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide has surpassed 4,000 and the market is still growing rapidly.

The increase in the number of Bitcoin ATMs comes in a period during which cryptocurrency businesses are prioritizing compliance, dealing with strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies.

Factors Behind the Increase in Demand For Bitcoin ATMs

On January 20, CCN reported that ShapeShift, a Switzerland-based cryptocurrency exchanges, received 18 subpoena requests from the U.S. authorities in 2018.

Although the number of requests received by ShapeShift was far less than that of Kraken, a major digital asset trading platform that received 315 subpoena requests from the U.S. government last year, it was relatively high given the fact that ShapeShift is not a U.S. corporation.

The U.S. government filed 66 percent of all subpoena requests received by Kraken, which serves 80 percent of its users outside of the U.S.

The rise in the demand for and popularity of crypto ATMs coincides with the G20's efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency sector with tightened regulatory frameworks.

Most major cryptocurrency markets in the likes of Japan and South Korea have implemented new policies in regards to transaction monitoring, user surveillance, and fraud prevention since 2017.

Ernst & Young Bitcoin

Bitcoin ATMs provide an alternative to strictly regulated cryptocurrency exchanges by allowing both buyers and sellers to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with minimal identification and KYC requirements.

But, there are some downsides to Bitcoin ATMs, especially for regular and experienced users. The fees on Bitcoin ATM transactions are percentage-based in most cases, leading to substantially higher fees than on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Most Bitcoin ATMs also have low daily limits for buyers and sellers, disallowing individuals from buying or selling large amounts of Bitcoin at a time to prevent the usage of ATMs in money laundering.

Story continues

Speaking to ValueWalk, Straight Up Capital managing partner Sean Keefe said that Bitcoin has the potential to become a key part of the e-commerce sector, which may contribute to the increasing demand for Bitcoin ATMs.

'E-commerce is over. Cryptocurrency is the future. Companies like Overstock.com are only doing Bitcoin transactions, and other digital conglomerates like Amazon and Facebook know the war chest is coming. Just like aol.com was a brand name in the mid-'90s, Bitcoin is just the start of many brands to come that will offer the same service. It's only a matter of time before everyone will have a Bitcoin option on their mobile devices,' Keefe said.

Not Popular in All Markets

In South Korea, for instance, despite being one of the largest cryptocurrency markets along with the U.S., Japan, and Europe, the usage of Bitcoin ATMs has declined throughout the last two years.

Bitcoin ATM companies such as Coinplug have pivoted to operating a regulated cryptocurrency exchange with previously obtained capital from venture capital firms.

A key to the long-term success of Bitcoin ATMs is to lower the transaction fees and to provide reasonable conversion rates. But, due to high maintenance costs, it remains uncertain whether these issues can be addressed in the months to come.

The bitcoin price will crater below $3,000 amid a mass sell-off. That's what futures trader Anthony Grisanti predicts about the ongoing Crypto Winter.

'I'm looking for a move down to $3,000, which would represent a real weakness in this market,' Grisanti told CNBC. 'It could be the driver that gets people to bail out of this and push it even lower.'

Trader: âPeople are Liquidating Their Positions'

Grisanti is a CNBC analyst who previously traded energy futures at Bear Stearns. Like other crypto bears, Grisanti believes it's only a matter of time before bitcoin collapses.

He attributed the recent price volatility to investors selling off their bitcoin holdings as they head for the exits. 'Every time this market does run, people are liquidating their positions,' Grisanti says.

Whether or not they're liquidating outright or the futures, they are liquidating. So I'm looking to sell this. At $3,800 is where I want to sell it. There's some resistance around $4,000, $4,100.

CNBC scott nations anthony grisanti talk bitcoin

Grisanti's fellow CNBC commentator, Scott Nations, also bashed bitcoin, saying it has no value and that he'd short it if he could.

'There's no value there,' says Nations, a former member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 'I absolutely want to be short [on bitcoin].'

âBaby, This is a Bubble!'

Nations also dissed millennial crypto enthusiasts, saying they're too clueless to understand the bubble they're witnessing now.

'If you are in your 20s, you have never seen an asset bubble,' Nations says. 'You were a teenager during the housing bubble. You were not even a teenager during the dotcom bubble.'

Well, baby, this is a bubble! And right now, it's coming unglued. I hope that people don't lose too much money on bitcoin, but that they do learn the lesson: This is a bubble, and this is how it unwinds. Unfortunately, it's a bit painful, but we have not reached the bottom yet.

Analysts: Interest in BTC Futures is Waning

Both Anthony Grisanti and Scott Nations say they believe that interest in bitcoin futures is waning because of the current market slump.

As CCN reported, Nasdaq â the world's second-largest stock exchange â plans to launch bitcoin futures in the first quarter of 2019 through a partnership with investment firm VanEck.

Similarly, Nasdaq's rival ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) â the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange â also plans to roll out a physically-settled bitcoin futures product in the first quarter of 2019.

Crypto Bear: BTC Fans Are like Trump Supporters

But the CNBC bitcoin bears are skeptical that there's a market for BTC futures, and that believers are merely deluding themselves.

'I think the interest is out of the market,' Grisanti says. 'Yeah sure, like Trump supporters, there are a few that believe this thing is going higher, [even] as they have their losses every day.'

Grisanti says this is not the right time for bitcoin. 'Maybe another currency comes to the forefront,' he speculated.

Grisanti says the bitcoin price is fluctuating between lows of $3,300 to $3,500 and highs of $4,000 to $4,100. And he doesn't see any hope of a breakout.

These Trump Supporters Are Bitcoin Bulls

For the record, Trump supporters include billionaire Peter Thiel.

Thiel â the openly gay co-founder of PayPal â has touted bitcoin as 'digital gold.' Thiel's net worth tops $2.5 billion.

Trump supporters bitcoin bulls Mick Mulvaney Peter Thiel

Another Trump supporter is this guy: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House Chief of Staff. Mulvaney has been a bitcoin advocate since 2014.

Mulvaney is currently director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). His job as OMB boss is to prepare the US President's budget proposals to Congress.

It is a very influential position at the right hand of the most powerful executive in the world. And the guy who holds that job is a bitcoin fan.

Cryptocurrency boom expected as Bitcoin marks 10th anniversary,Sophie Williams,2019-01-06 08:52:06,full,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/bitcoin-investors-still-positive-about-future-of-cryptocurrency-as-it-marks-its-10th-anniversary-a4030726.html,standard.co.uk,"Investors are remaining positive about Bitcoin as it marks its 10-year anniversary, despite a worrying drop in value in recent months.","Investors are remaining positive about Bitcoin as it marks its 10-year anniversary, despite a worrying drop in value in recent months.The cryptocurrency has come a long way since the bitcoin blockchain was created on January 3, 2009.At one point, it was considered so worthless that, in May 2010, Florida-based programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin, valued at the time at $30.Had he kept the currency, it would have been worth more than $38 million, according to The Verge.However, over the past year, Bitcoin has lost around 80 per cent in value.Clem Chambers, an author on Trading Cryptocurrencies, told the Standard that he invested between $1,000 and $2,500 on most of his initial Bitcoins and sold them at $18,000.He predicts another boom for the cryptocurrency in the future.'Bitcoin will boom again in a year and blockchain/cryptocurrencies and other applications will define the next 25 years in the same way as online/dotcom has defined the last 25,"" he said.'Bitcoin is the tip of the spear and the tip of the iceberg. In both cases you want to be at the right end of it and you don't want to have the wrong positioning as it emerges.'Bitcoin is marking its 10th anniversary / AFP/Getty ImagesStephen Morrison also invested in the cryptocurrency and believes that they 'are here to stay'.He told the Standard: 'In hindsight I would have sold in January and bought back in now. I would have more diligently researched coins and projects and relied less on my emotions to make my decisions, but I would most definitely invest my money and my time in Bitcoin and the blackchain again and I believe in the blockchain.'Mr Morrison noted that there are projects involving Bitcoin to 'make many financial transactions, faster, fairer and less expensive"".He added: 'Bitcoin and the blockchain have their faults, but they are here to stay. It is moving more and more into our media, our movies and our stores. Major financial institutions are investing and more and more people from all walks of life are getting on board.'Here in the UK, the City watchdog has flagged up plans to put much tighter reins on the trading of volatile cryptocurrencies today as bitcoin plunged again this week. The Financial Conduct Authority will consult early next year on a potential ban on the sale of products to retail customers such as contracts for difference linked to cryptocurrencies.",standard.co.uk,820,world,GB,en,Sophie Williams,https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/25/14/anonymous-bitcoin-cash-315117.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,False,@EveningStandard,12.59488,2cf138607cfa8f9cd616ee74f926e24b
"Bitcoin latest: It's NOT WORTH mining BTC anymore, says leading cryptocurrency academic",Darren Parkin Of Coin Rivet,2019-01-30 14:54:00,full,https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1080092/Bitcoin-BTC-price-news-latest-worth-mining-Gavin-Brown-crv,express.co.uk,"BITCOIN'S descent below $3,400 yesterday has now confirmed that it is no longer profitable to mine the cryptocurrency.","Bitcoin: It might not be worth mining BTC, says a leading academic (Image: GETTY)The landmark figure was passed as BTC continues its landslide beyond the point where the amount of energy expended in the mining operation for the original crypto far outweighs the value of bitcoin. The tipping point came in November when bitcoin plunged from a steady $6,500 and slipped to levels that left many miners ceasing their operations. Pockets remain throughout the world, but the current state of the crypto markets means mining has been significantly curtailed. However, one of the UK's most senior cryptocurrency academics maintains that repeatedly breaking the $3,400 line may be bad news for miners, but it certainly is not signalling the end of bitcoin.Gavin Brown, senior lecturer in finance at Manchester Metropolitan University, said:Â 'As bitcoin falls to below $3,400 there is significant reaction to the fact that this price is now below the global production weighted cost of $4,060 in quarter four last year.'Although damaging to the bitcoin mining community this will not mean the end of bitcoin, at least in the short to medium term.'Firstly, marginal costs of production are driven by electricity costs which represent the majority of total mining costs.'However, hardware expenditure - mining rigs etc - are a material outlay and critically are a sunk cost meaning that miners may continue with their efforts for longer than perhaps expected.' Hardware expenditure - mining rigs etc - are a material outlay and critically are a sunk costGavin BrownMr Brown also suggested that, if global prices were to continue to trade at a discount to the marginal costs of mining then more miners would inevitably withdraw.Yet, in turn, that would raise the probability of success for those remaining when mining any given block.He warned: 'The aggregate effect of this will be more keenly felt not in a sharp decline in the price of bitcoin but rather in the size, or depth, of the bitcoin mining community which by extension will weaken the decentralisation of the underlying bitcoin blockchain.'Finally, it should be noted that the exit of miners globally will not be evenly spread across the network geographically.'Rather, we are likely to see locations of higher electricity costs see more pronounced rates of withdrawal compared with, say, a low-cost Chinese miner who can often obtain electricity at discounted rates as low as $1,260 per bitcoin.' Bitcoin: BTC dropped below $3,400 yesterday (Image: GETTY)This, he adds, will lead to greater centralisation of the bitcoin mining community in places such as China which reportedly already hosts 74 percent of bitcoin mining and exposes a threat of cyberattacks.He said: 'Such a shift will only increase the pre-existing criticism about the extent to which bitcoin is truly decentralised, and therefore represents an inherent flaw, in turn exposing the network to potential attacks.'Overall, I am relatively bearish on bitcoin for the medium to long term.'It remains the market leader by first mover advantage and exhibits âflight to quality' type attributes as evidenced by a BTC dominance in excess of 50 per cent.'Nonetheless, it is the gateway cryptocurrency for many new adopters and trading pairs on the exchanges, but with new use cases and an appetite to better understand the underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT) by industry the future may be bleak for Bitcoin, but strong for the wider space of cryptoassets.'Coin RivetÂ is a website bringingÂ news, information, analysis, opinion and insight from the fast-moving blockchain world.",express.co.uk,555,finance,GB,en,"Darren Parkin Of Coin Rivet,Gavin Brown",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/22/750x445/1080092.jpg,False,,12.594539,9e88b580816d07a25511eaa8723cfda6
"As bitcoin tests monthly lows, one investor predicts better days ahead",Duncan Riley,2019-01-21 01:58:01,full,https://siliconangle.com/2019/01/20/bitcoin-tests-monthly-lows-one-investor-predicts-better-days-ahead/,siliconangle.com,"As bitcoin tests monthly lows, one investor predicts better days ahead - SiliconANGLE","As the price of bitcoin tested new monthly lows over the weekend, one investor was far more upbeat, predicting better days ahead for the cryptocurrency.
Alistair Milne, chief investment officer at Atlanta Digital Currency Fund, made the forecast on social media of a return to form for bitcoin.
Starting with an explanation of where bitcoin has been previously, Milne claimedÂ thatÂ bitcoin has reached mainstream awareness, so 'fear of missing out' has returned.
'Investors are now very aware that bitcoin is like trading gold with 100x leverage and, next year, bitcoin's inflation/production rate will actually be *lower* than gold's,' he wrote. 'No-one appears to doubt the usefulness of Gold as an investment, they shouldn't doubt gold 2.0,' Milne said in aÂ subsequent tweet.
'It takes time for sentiment to change. 30-50million people owning crypto is not the industry's peak,' Milne added. 'The next bull run will decide which public blockchains persist for the next 100 years. I believe bitcoin is currently the *only* sure thing.'
The 'gold 2.0' narrative isn't a new one. EWN notedÂ thatÂ Dan Held, a former Blockchain and Uber Technologies Inc. executive argues that bitcoin is a store of value rather than pure digital cash. Held argues that while bitcoin can be used as an online medium of exchange it was 'purpose-built' to be gold-like, rather than a decentralized, digital version of the U.S. dollar.
The Winklevoss Twins are also on record as saying that bitcoin is 'better at being gold than gold itself.'
Whether gold 2.0 or a medium of exchange, the price of bitcoin has continued to decline.Â As of 9:45 p.m. EST, bitcoin was trading at $3,543.22, down 4 percent over the last 24 hours and up slightly from a daily low of $3,506.67. Bitcoin'sÂ low for the past month wasÂ $3,497.67 on Jan. 14.

Now That's What I Call Crypto: 10 Years Of The Best Of Bitcoin,Brian Benchoff,2019-01-29 15:01:37,full,https://hackaday.com/2019/01/29/now-thats-what-i-call-crypto-10-years-of-the-best-of-bitcoin/,hackaday.com,"On January 3rd, 2009, the Genesis Block was created.

Because of the nature of Bitcoin, all transactions lead back to this block. This is where Bitcoin began, almost exactly ten years ago.
The Genesis Block was created by Satoshi, a person or persons we know nothing about. In the decade since, we've seen the astonishing rise and meteoric descent of Bitcoin, and then it happened again after the bubble was re-inflated.
Due to the nature of Bitcoins, blockchains, and ledgers, the entire history of Bitcoin has been recorded. Every coin spent and every satoshi scrupled has been recorded for all to see. It's time for a retrospective, and not just because I wanted to see some art based on the covers of Now That's What I Call Music albums. No, ten years is a lot of stories to tell. The Genesis Device
The entire idea of a blockchain is to record each and every transaction. That's pretty much the only solution a blockchain solves, and that's straight from the mouth ofÂ the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Because of this, we can trace Bitcoin back to the very beginning. Here it is, Block #0, or Block #1, there was an off-by-one error in the early days, âdoncha know.
Apart from being the foundation upon which the entire Bitcoin blockchain is built, there is a bit more data in the Genesis Block. The text, 'The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks' is embedded in the raw block data. There are different interpretations on why this data exists. It could be that Satoshi simply picked up a copy of The London Times and wrote down the headline, just like you would hold up a picture of a newspaper to timestamp a photograph. It could be a comment on a fractional reserve banking system. In any event, if you ever find a copy of The Times from January 3, 2009, you've just found half a million dollars. That's what Bitcoin collectors are askingÂ for a copy of this newspaper.
One Point Five Million Dollar Pizza
At one point, this Papa John's pizza was worth $750,000. Image credit Laszlo.
It's a tautology, but Bitcoin is only worth something if it's worth something. A medium of exchange, if it were. In the early days of Bitcoin, back in early 2010, the community surrounding Bitcoin was a lot like Dogecoin community of 2014. Your Bitcoin program just generated these âcoins'. No, you couldn't spend them anywhere. People were collecting Bitcoins, because it was something to do. It was novel. People were giving away Bitcoins for free, just to watch them move around the blockchain.
Then, in May of 2010, something changed. Over on the bitcointalk forums, Laszlo came upon an agreement with another member. Laszlo would give 10,000 BTC to another forum member for two Papa Johns pizzas. The pizzas were reportedly a large âworks' and a large âgarden fresh', and cost the buyer between $30 and $40 USD. Before, people were giving each other Bitcoins for a few cents each, but Laszlo's pizzas are the first time Bitcoin could be assigned a value in a real currency. In this exchange, one Bitcoin was equal to 0.3 cents. At the heights of the Bitcoin bubble, these pizzas would be worth $1.5 Million USD.
Laszlo is famous in the Bitcoin community, and not just because he spent a million dollars on two pizzas. He was one of the first to release a GPU miner, simply as a fun project while learning OpenCL. He mined all his coins on an nVidia 9800 GTX+ / hackintosh rig, later moving on to a 2x Radeon 5970 rig. Your GPU miners, especially the ones running on OS X (however rare that may be) can trace their origin back to the guy who bought a million dollar pizza. The guy that sent him the pizzas? He bought a house with his pizza bitcoins.
Buy Drugs With Magic Internet Money!
While supporters of Bitcoin say it's an experiment in economics, the solution to the Byzantine General's problem, an innovative new technology; this isn't what the majority of people thought in 2011. The first popular use of Bitcoin, outside weird forums based out of Neckbeardistan, was as a way to buy drugs.
Supporters of Bitcoin willÂ say it was an interesting technology built by some very smart people, andÂ maybe a few entrepreneurs got into the game before cashing out in Puerto Rico. This is a false narrative. The cultural zeitgeist of 2011 and 2012 is that Bitcoin was a way to buy drugs on the Internet. Bitcoin was how you bought drugs on the Internet, full stop. You could buy drugs with Bitcoin on The Silk Road. This was the purpose of Bitcoin (aside from buying pizzas).
The Silk Road was an online market operating on the Tor network. The easiest way for anyone to access the Silk Road was to download a Tor browser, copy and paste the Silk Road address, and look at the amazing variety of products available on the Silk Road. You could buy weed,Â fentanyl someone stole from their grandmother, zanzibars, heroin â actual heroin, with a picture of a beautiful red and black flower â and whatever else your dopamine receptors desired. Chloroform? Sure thing, buddy, but it doesn't work like you think it does. Cocaine? Okay. Crack? No problem. You should actually buy cocoa paste, though, because that's the most efficient way to ship it. How do you pay for these things? Magic Internet Moneyâ¢! ThisÂ paragraph is a completely accurate representation of what the public thought Bitcoin was for in 2012.
The Silk Road was started by Dread Pirate Roberts, a pseudonym for Ross Ulbricht to 'give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.' This is the central tenet of crypto-anarchism. If you'd like to know what crypto-anarchism is, this is the dictionary definition â it is using cryptography to live in a world without a government and its exclusive right on the use of force.
Unfortunately for Ulbricht, we do live in a world where the government has the exclusive right to the use of force. He's currently serving life, plus forty years, without the possibility of parole for money laundering, computer hacking, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. It is incorrect to say Ulbricht is in jail because he solicited a murder-for-hire; these were not included in his indictment, and the lead prosecutor said none of the murder-for-hire allegations occurred.
Some Good Was Made
The Bitcoin Bubble wasn't all about buying drugs over the Internet. A few people made it big, some bought yachts, and others did something productive. The biggest headliner went by the name of Pine, and The Pineapple Fund did good.
The Pineapple Fund started with an individual that claimed to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund gave away 5104 BTC, turning that into $55 Million for charities ranging from the EFF ($1 Million), the Internet Archive ($2 Million), The Water Project, a project to bring clean water to Sub-Saharan Africa ($1 Million), the ACLU ($2 Million) and the OpenBSD foundation ($50,000).
The disbursement of Bitcoin was, 'timed with the 2017 crypto bubble', which was absolutely the best time to get rid of Bitcoin. If you ever get a time machine, go to 2010, trade some pizzas for Bitcoin, then go to December 2017 and give your Bitcoin to worthy causes. That's the most good you'll ever be able to do.
My GPU Miner Is Cool Runnings
While not directly related to Bitcoin, Dogecoin started off as a cryptocurrency that was as fun as million-dollar pizzas. The only difference? The fun never stopped. Dogecoin was founded almost exactly five years ago by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer at the height of the crypto craze. It's a joke coin, yes, but it's also a such coin. Wow.
Just months after the creation of Dogecoin, these coins were being given away on reddit and other forums. Dogecoin was, like the early days of Bitcoin, almost a joke but not quite. The coins were being traded on markets, but the value was so small an individual coin was of basically no value. Dogecoin was the equivalent of likes on Twitter; it didn't mean anything, no one was going to get rich off of it, but giving someone a few hundred Dogecoin was appreciated.
Then the jokes continued. The Dogecoin community decided to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. Yes,Â Cool Runnings, the 1993 movie starring John Candy, was made real once again. This was done as a joke. A joke cryptocurrency made a relatively obscure movie (that could have used more ninjas) popular again and sent a team to the Olympics. Later, the Dogecoin community sponsored a NASCAR.
Although Dogecoin isn't getting a lot of press anymore, neither are any other cryptocurrencies. That's a shame, because Dogecoin, by redesign, has an unlimited supply. There will only ever be 21 Million Bitcoin, but there will be an infinite number of Dogecoin. No one knows what will happen when the last Bitcoin is mined, or what will happen to any deflationary coin years down the road. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is an inflationary coin, and by far the most popular inflationary coin.
The history of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mirrors the history of money. We've gone from people collecting bits of gold they found in a stream or bits they willed into existence on their CPU. Great mines were built to dig gold out of the ground, leaving a mercury-soaked Superfund site for future generations to clean up, and GPU mines belched COâ into the atmosphere. Conmen capitalized on tulips and ICO startups. Finally, the whole system collapsed. The entire history of economics and money has been condensed into a single decade, all thanks to Bitcoin, and years from now a Nobel-winning economist will accept the reward, knowing that they got their start with Magic Internet Money in 2012.",hackaday.com,2957,news,US,en,"Brian Benchoff,Joe Steele,Mr Name Required",https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/blockchain-featured.jpg,False,@hackaday,12.591189,91c1afad00f457ad0e02649f8bf3318e

In a Reddit AMA (ask me anything) the founders of Gemini Trust Company fielded a cavalcade of crypto and non-crypto related questions, and despite the recent plunge in the value of digital assets, the twins showed unwavering support for the nascent industry. In defining crypto success, the two drew parallels to the internet and its global accessibility where counterparts are available around the clock and accessible at the push of a button. A clear shot at the current fiat money system. 'âImagine if your email worked like your money, that is to say it was available from 9-5pm Mon-Fri and it took sometimes up to 3-5 days for someone in another country to get your message?'' â Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of Gemini Trust Read:From $100 to $1 million, here are the 11 most outrageous bitcoin predictions But the two said, bitcoin, BTCUSD, +0.19% Â the world's largest digital currency, is a store of value, not a payment mechanism â what many believe bitcoin's core vision was when created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym given to the creator of the first cryptocurrency. 'I believe bitcoin is a store of value (given its current properties) and I agree that being a really good store of value is in conflict with being a good medium of exchange. It's hard for money to be good at both at the same time,' they said.

Read:How bitcoin has failed to achieve Satoshi Nakamoto's original intent, in one chart The store of value argument is what the twins base their sky-high forecast â a prediction they have not wavered on. 'Our thesis around bitcoin's upside remains unchanged,' they wrote. 'We believe bitcoin is better at being gold than gold. If we're right, then over time the market cap of bitcoin will surpass the ~7trillion dollar market cap of gold.' Given the maximum supply of bitcoins is 21 million coins, a market value of $7 trillion would put the price of a single bitcoin at a minimum value of $333,000.

A Coinbase Exec Is Predicting Bitcoin Will Turn A Big Corner This Year,Billy Bambrough,2019-01-21 07:55:00,full,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/01/21/a-coinbase-exec-is-predicting-bitcoin-will-turn-a-big-corner-this-year/,forbes.com,Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency has struggled over the last year as sky-high expectations for the sector after 2017's massive bull run have either stalled or been delayed...,"Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency industry has struggled over the last year as sky-high expectations for the sector after 2017's massive bull run have either stalled or been delayed.
The bitcoin price has meanwhile stagnated after a bitcoin cash civil war-inspired sell-off resulted in many cryptocurrency holders opting to recoup their losses than hold on for the next bull runâif it ever comes.Â  However, bitcoin and cryptocurrency developments have continued to rumble on andÂ Marcus Hughes, U.K. lead counsel for San Francisco-based crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase, expects this year to mean big changes for bitcoin regulation around the world.
 Bitcoin has failed to live up to the impossibly high expectations the 2017 bull run setâbut once... [+] regulation catches up, it might get there. Getty ""Within the next year or two, we'll see big developments,"" Hughes said in an interview. ""Regulation will take shape this year, particularly in Europe.""
In the U.K. the country's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which oversees its huge banking industry, is carrying out a consultation that could see it banÂ the sale of derivatives based on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to consumers and last month the U.K. government said it stands ready to empowerÂ the FCA to oversee all cryptocurrency assets.

The FCA is also investigating some 18 companies over cryptocurrency use, it was revealed by a freedom of information request by the Telegraph newspaper.
Nicky Morgan, who chairs the influential TreasuryÂ select committee group of British lawmakers, said: ""It is clear that the government and the FCA share the committee's concerns on crypto-assets, including the lack of regulation, minimal consumer protection and anonymity aiding money laundering â¦ The committee will keep a close eye on these consultations and will continue to press for regulation."" Meanwhile, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is calling for standardized regulations for cryptocurrency operations within the E.U. in an attempt toÂ eliminate unfair regulatory arbitrage while protecting bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors across the bloc.
""We could end up with E.U. member states creating their own crypto laws, but it's certainly possible we'll get a unified approach in Europe,"" said Huges. ""It would make life for companies like Coinbase a lot easier.""
Hughes, who joined investment bank Morgan Stanley just ahead ofÂ the global financial crisis in June 2009, stepped into the cryptocurrency sector in the midst of a bear market that's been labeledÂ crypto winter for its debilitating effects on the industry.
""The view amongst the likes of Morgan Stanley executives is that bitcoin and cryptocurrency does now have staying power. They don't expect it to go away any time soon.""
The bitcoin price has fallen by some 80% over the last year after an epic bull run throughout 2017 that saw the price skyrocket to almost $20,000 per bitcoin in December 2017.
""Coinbase takes the long view on bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency prices,"" said Hughes said, though he admits he checks the bitcoin price regularly.Â ""We need to move beyond the speculation phase of bitcoin and cryptocurrency to the utilityÂ phase. The utility phase will mean bitcoin and crypto becomes more widely accepted and understood.""
 The bitcoin price has fallen steadily since the end of 2017, casting doubt over institutional... [+] interest in the sector. CoinDesk 
But despite the fall in the bitcoin price, Hughes thinks some of the biggest global banks are still keen to get into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, with a lack of consistent and established regulation holding them back.
""A number have dipped their toes but it is a slow burn process,"" Hughes said. ""Regulation will help a lot, in particular around custody offerings. These things take time. Clients of investment banks will expect regulation to be in place.
""I would be surprised if other traditional financial servicesÂ executives didn't make the move across to the bitcoin and cryptocurrency world,"" Hughes added. ""As the industry matures and is better regulated it will need the talent and experience to manage it.""",forbes.com,49,finance,US,en,"Billy Bambrough,Senior Contributor",https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/thumbnails/blog_5660/pt_5660_1932_o.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200,False,@billybambrough,12.57826,0dccd3cb6be555160709789c939cf7a9
Bitwise Files With the US SEC for a Physically Held Bitcoin ETF,Adrian Zmudzinski,2019-01-10 19:36:00,full,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitwise-files-with-the-us-sec-for-a-physically-held-bitcoin-etf,cointelegraph.com,Cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a new Bitcoin ETF.,"Cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has applied with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a new Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), according to a registration form published today, Jan. 10.According to the form, Bitwise's proposed ETF will track the Bitwise Bitcoin Total Return Index, the value of which is 'calculated based on the prices of bitcoin that the Index Provider derives from bitcoin price transactions occurring on cryptocurrency exchanges.' According to a press release accompanying the newly filed form, the firm's proposed Bitcoin ETF reportedly differs from other previously proposed Bitcoin ETFs in that it draws prices from a variety of crypto exchanges, with the aim of better representing the market.Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF reportedly also differs from other applications in that it would require 'regulated third-party custodians to hold its physical bitcoin.'In the firm's press release, John Hyland, Global Head of ETFs at Bitwise declared:'Having a regulated bank or trust company hold physical assets of a fund has been the standard under U.S. fund regulation for the last 80 years, and we believe that is now possible with Bitcoin.'As Cointelegraph reported in July, Bitwise had filed with the SEC to launch a crypto ETF tracking the Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund, a basket of ten cryptocurrencies. To press time, a decision from the SEC is still pending. Â An ETF is a security that tracks an asset or a group of assets and is traded the same way in which stocks are on an exchange. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has denied that it is considering allowing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.The crypto industry has long awaited the approval of a Bitcoin or generally crypto ETF by U.S. regulators, since a number of firms have applied to launch such products in the country. In December, the SEC further postponed its decision on a Bitcoin ETF by investment firm VanEck and blockchain company SolidX on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Â setting the new deadline for Feb. 27, 2019.Also in December, an SEC commissioner said 'not to hold your breath' waiting for a Bitcoin ETF, speaking at the Digital Asset Investment Forum held in Washington.",cointelegraph.com,1696,news,US,en,Adrian Zmudzinski,https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1200_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy83Yzc2NzM5NDFkNWY0YWE4MjdhZTU3YzExMTE5MWU0NS5qcGc=.jpg,False,@cointelegraph,12.577345,bc2e2e2c8aef926f3f5b52693159431f
How to Invest in Bitcoin â¦ Before the Herd Comes Rumbling Back,Fred Marion,2019-01-11 11:28:48,full,https://investorplace.com/2019/01/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-2019/,investorplace.com,Few investments are as confusing as bitcoin. But that's an advantage. Learn how to invest in bitcoin before the masses for a bigger return.,"Source: Shutterstock Learning how to invest in bitcoin reminds me of learning how to use the internet in the '90s. Few investments are as confusing. Stocks have been trading for more than 400 years. But cryptocurrency is barely a decade old. Questions and confusion are inevitable.
If you're willing to put in the extra effort today, you'll beat the masses tomorrow. I'm convinced bitcoin will only grow in scale and opportunity. The crypto revolution is just beginning.
Being on the outside means you can't profit from it in the future.

How to invest in bitcoin step 1: Before you begin
When you're learning how to invest in bitcoin, I recommend buying an extremely small amount to start. Don't invest more than 1 or 2% of your investable assets. Keep in mind, you don't have to buy an entire bitcoin either. You can buy as little as 0.00000001 bitcoin.
Familiarise yourself with the process of buying, moving and storing bitcoin. It's not like traditional online banking. Passwords are long and complicated. The terminology is new. Some wallets aren't intuitive.
If you make a mistake, do it with a few dollars â¦ not hundreds of dollars.
Step 2: Getting started
To buy your first bitcoin, you'll need:

A computer
A mobile phone
A notebook
Identification (i.e. your passport or driver's license)
Proof of address (a recent utility bill with your name and address)
A printer
Your bank details

Remember, you're responsible for your account when you buy bitcoin. If you forget your password or private key, you can lose everything.
If you send bitcoin to the wrong location, you can't call up your bank and cancel your transaction either. That's it. There are no refunds.
Make backups and hard copies of everything. Buy a physical notebook or folder and use it to store usernames and passwords.
You may look at this list and think, 'this is too much like hard work.' But remember, the crypto banking revolution is coming first. Then, crypto will permeate just about every industry on the planet.
Step 3: On-ramps
To start buying bitcoin, you need an 'on-ramp.'
An on-ramp is a website where you can convert traditional currency into bitcoin. People call them 'exchanges.'
Gemini is one I've used. Creating an account on an exchange is very similar to creating an online bank account. You'll first create a username and password. Then, you'll provide the documentation you gathered in Step 2.
After a 1-2 day verification period, you'll be able link a bank account with your exchange account. Deposit some fiat money. When your deposit clears, you can use it to buy bitcoin.
Beyond Gemini, there are several options:

These exchanges let you buy bitcoin, but I don't store my bitcoin on them. They can (and do) get hacked.
Which brings us to step 4 â¦
Step 4: Wallets
After purchasing bitcoin on an exchange, transfer it to a wallet. Your bitcoin 'wallet' is a single place to store, send and receive bitcoinÂ â one that's not owned by the exchange.
There are several types of wallets:

Software on a mobile or desktop device
A dedicated hardware device
A USB stick
A piece of paper

Some wallets are only designed for bitcoin. That means they only interact with the Bitcoin blockchain.
Other crypto assets have their own wallets. There are even wallets that support dozens of different crypto assets.
One popular hardware wallet is called Trezor. It allows you to store bitcoin offline.
Wallets like Electrum let you store bitcoin on a computer. If you want to store your bitcoin in a web-wallet, look at Blockchain.com's wallet.

When you're comfortable transferring bitcoin from an exchange to your wallet, go back to the exchange. Try trading bitcoin for another cryptocurrency like Ethereum. Not only will you know how to invest in bitcoin before the masses, you'll be even further ahead of the pack.

"Ten years after the genesis block, bitcoin's been captured by the system it was supposed to replace",Elizabeth Lopatto,2019-01-03 16:00:09,full,https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox,theverge.com,It's been ten years since Satoshi Nakamoto coded the first block of the bitcoin ledger.,"If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.


Depending on how you count its birth, bitcoin turned 10 years old today. The first lines of code were committed to the bitcoin blockchain on January 3rd, 2009, a few months after the publication of the original whitepaper. These lines of code, known as the 'genesis block,' are credited to the person or persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto. 
On January 12th, Nakamoto sent 10 bitcoin to Hal Finney, and a new finance counterculture was born. At this point, the bitcoin's worth was negligible. Users essentially gave each other bitcoins as rewards for good comments in forums. The first 'real' transaction took place on May 22nd, 2010. Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin, or about $30. (At current prices, 10,000 bitcoin would be worth $38 million. I hope that pizza was tasty.) 
For most of its life, bitcoin drew from three main overlapping communities: the small community of original investors and true believers, the blockchain technology aficionados, and the speculators who are just here to make some money, ma'am. Lately, another community has emerged: old-fashioned stodgy finance types. 
Originally, bitcoin was money with a philosophy: instead of a central bank, it had programming and Nakamoto's whitepaper, both of which suggested skepticism about ordinary financial institutions. But Nakamoto vanished. As the digital currency took off, the system that was supposed to work without trust developed trust issues. And as the bitcoin's price has risen, it's become another investment vehicle for the financial system it was meant to replace. 10 years later, bitcoin is part of the system it was meant to overthrow.
BORN FROM CRISIS
If you had asked me 10 years ago, I would not have imagined finance could have a counterculture. But in 2008, as the banking crisis was in full swing, a group of anarchists, libertarians, and other dissatisfied tech-savvy true believers created one. (There had been other attempts at digital cash, but none of them truly took off.) In August 2008, someone registered bitcoin dot org as a domain; on Halloween that year, a paper went up describing a decentralized system for electronic transactions that didn't rely on trust. The original Satoshi Nakamoto white paper begins (emphasis mine), 'A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.' 
You can see the influences of the banking crisis on bitcoin's ideology: first of all, it's a specific distrust of financial institutions. Beyond any number of other breaches of trust that took place during the financial crisis, a money market fund called the Reserve Primary Fund did something very scary: it broke the buck. If you had invested $1, you'd get 97 cents back. This was because the money market fund had invested in Lehman Brothers, a financial firm that had just gone belly-up.
In some sense, money isn't 'real'
Money market funds, at the time, were considered as safe as an actual savings account; $3 trillion had been invested in them as of September 2008, according to USA Today. But they aren't as safe as savings accounts, which is why they had better rates of returns â as investors found out, to their surprise and dismay. (Regulations around money market funds have subsequently changed.)
Contamination from the Lehman bankruptcy spread into the wider financial markets, making it clear how closely banks were tied together. There are several ways to respond to this: one is to strengthen financial regulations, tweak the system, and leave it running, hopefully in a more stable way. Another response is to create a new system without these specific hazards. Suddenly, a lot of people were in the mood to take bitcoin seriously.
Bitcoin highlights how fundamentally bizarre money is. In some sense, money isn't 'real' in the way that a tree is. It's a human invention, a value token that makes exchange easier. But it's real enough â people fight and die for it, empires fall for lack of it, and I would personally go homeless if I did not use it to pay my rent. Money is like Tinkerbell in Peter Pan: it's real if enough people believe in it. And in 2009, a lot of people were looking for alternatives to the mainstream financial system that had catastrophically failed. The core of banking, as most people understand it, is money. But what does money look like when the bankers are taken away? Of all the previous attempts at internet-based currency â and there were many â bitcoin was the one that broke out as the best possible alternative to society's collective anxieties around the financial system.
INTO THE UNDERWORLD
Bitcoin is structured in a way that reveals its ideology. The idea of a peer-to-peer money network hews back to old-fashioned Silicon Valley disruption. You don't have to pay a fee to send money to a third party like a bank or Western Union. But the original ideology is even more radical than that: if you believe that the state is simply a designated force for violence, then it's possible to also believe that fiat currency â for instance, the dollar â is an enforced state monopoly. Bitcoin upends that monopoly, serving in part as a currency-based way to hate the government. 
Even the term 'mining' conveys some of this thought: many investors see bitcoin as a commodity, like gold. (Let's genuflect at the gold standard and keep it moving.) There's also the finite nature of bitcoin: under the current protocol, there can only be 21 million bitcoin in the world. More than 17 million have already been mined. The rest will be released at a predictable mining rate, which has slowed as more of the supplies have come into existence. No central bank or president can make that system run any faster or goose inflation to suit their political agenda.
The closure of Silk Road was the end of bitcoin's beginning
The other key technology for dodging banking institutions â and the state â is the distributed ledger. Anyone can access the public parts of the 'blockchain,' a ledger of all transactions made over time. No institution, at least in theory, is required to ensure trustworthy transactions. If you can keep your wallet anonymous, they don't even need to know who you are.
But as the last decade has made clear, removing trust as a component in one part of the financial system means that trust problems pop up somewhere else, which is how the counterculture formed. In order to make your investment in bitcoin worthwhile, you had to convince others that the investment was worthwhile too. Bitcoin communities sprang up on platforms like IRC and Reddit.
The most significant community for early bitcoin, though, was dark web marketplace Silk Road. Founded by Dread Pirate Roberts â who would later be revealed as Ross Ulbricht â the promise of Silk Road was also essentially libertarian. The idea was that anything could be traded, regardless of whether the state viewed it as legal. The trade was dominated by marijuana, fake IDs, benzos and other prescription drugs that were all facilitated by bitcoin. When the Silk Road was seized by the US government in 2013, that seizure included 144,336 bitcoins that belonged to Ulbricht. 
The closure of Silk Road was the end of bitcoin's beginning. It was perhaps the moment it became clear that removing financial institutions from money would not necessarily mean a more trustworthy environment, and it also didn't guarantee protection from the state. When Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, that would solidify bitcoin's trust problems.
Mt. Gox ('Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange') wasn't originally founded for bitcoin, but it launched a bitcoin exchange early in 2010. Mt. Gox let people buy bitcoin and sell using bank transfers; in 2011, its founder, Jed McCaleb sold it to Mark KarpelÃ¨s. The early years of Mt. Gox demonstrated that online currency meant new risks: 'hacks, outages, a run-in with the US government, and a $75 million lawsuit,' Adrianne Jeffries wrote for The Verge.










A protest outside Mt. Gox headquarters in 2014.


Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after clients complained that they couldn't withdraw their bitcoin. Its failure could have been catastrophic; Mt. Gox was responsible, by some estimates, for 70 percent of all bitcoin ever traded as of February 2014. 'Behind the scenes,' Jeffries wrote, 'KarpelÃ¨s had discovered that an attacker had slowly been draining all of Mt. Gox's bitcoins without being noticed. The company filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, citing $64 million in liabilities.' Bitcoin's price skyrocketed in the years that followed, which let at least some of the creditors cash out at 2014-era rates, but that wasn't the real problem. The promise of bitcoin was that your money wouldn't be held hostage by a failing bank, but that's exactly what had happened. 
Mt. Gox and the other exchanges function essentially as the bitcoin version of commodity exchanges, simplifying the experience of trading bitcoin. They allow people to set the rate for bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies), move from fiat currency (state-issued, like dollars) into cryptocurrency, and buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Their existence made it easier for ordinary plebs to get into bitcoin, and they brought new kinds of security risks, too. Some of the troubles Mt. Gox had early on plagued later exchanges like Coinbase and suggested that digital money had new problems that paper-based money did not. While you could break into my house and steal the $40 sitting next to my laptop, this is time-intensive for little reward. Figuring out how to hack the exchanges, however, could lead to tens of millions of dollars from a single breach.
Regular banks and exchanges aren't immune to hacking, but they pour money into making themselves harder targets. Bitcoin exchanges, however, 'may not have had the capital on hand, time, or even the technical ability to ramp up security features fast enough to ward off potential attackers,' John Sedunov, an assistant professor of finance at Villanova University, told The Washington Post in 2018.
BUILDING A SMARTER COIN
But even as Mt. Gox melted down and the Silk Road got busted, bitcoin continued to enter the mainstream. At the end of 2014, Microsoft began accepting bitcoin payments, according to Cointelegraph. In 2015, bitcoin was a cover story in The Economist. During this period, other cryptocurrencies â also based on the blockchain â began to emerge, the most important of which was Ethereum, launched in 2014, with an initial coin offering (ICO) that raised $18 million. 
Ethereum was the beginning of another big shift in the community: the change in focus from bitcoin per se to blockchain as a technology. Using the blockchain, Ethereum lets users write applications and make money from their work. The best-known application is the 'smart contract.' (Though this technology bills itself as a way of replacing lawyers, it is incredibly difficult to get lawyers out of anything once they've dug in. Just saying!) Here's a very reductive way of establishing a smart contract: let's say you and I have agreed that if I write you a history of bitcoin, you'll send me $10 on my birthday this year. We can do that via a legally enforceable contract, which involves lawyers, notaries, and so on â or we can do it via Ethereum. In the latter case, you put $10 worth of smart coins in escrow, and when the terms of the contract are met, those coins are released to me. If I don't meet the terms of our agreement, the coins are released back to you.
Increasingly, bitcoin left behind its original community of true believers
While Ethereum was the most meaningful of these companies, plenty of other ICOs came into existence: NXT Neo, Spectrecoin, Stratis, and EOS among them, often tied to specific businesses and products. The expanded universe of blockchain technology â a term absolutely no one agrees on, incidentally â took shape as various governments woke up to these new cryptocurrencies as taxable, potentially regulatable investment vehicles. In 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the money cops) announced that under some circumstances, financing events for digital currencies would be regarded as securities, and it proceeded to file suit against a string of scammy coin projects for violating securities law.
Now, depending on your attitude, this is potentially a way of legitimizing cryptocurrency ('it's so real that the government is choosing to regulate it as an investment vehicle!') or a betrayal of the initial government-free promise upon which the Nakamoto entity launched bitcoin. Increasingly, though, bitcoin had left behind its original community of true believers. 
During 2017, bitcoin's price surged more than 1,000 percent, which may explain why it was the focus of such intense interest by people who, you know, make money professionally. (Later, a University of Texas finance professor suggested that half of this rise was due to market manipulation.) On December 17th, 2017, bitcoin hit its all-time high of $20,000. Cryptocurrency-related crime surged as well â even though, by August 2018, a DEA agent told Bloomberg that the majority of bitcoin transactions were by speculators, rather than the black market types that dominated bitcoin during the Silk Road days.
2018 was rougher for those speculators, as bitcoin fell off 80 percent from its high the year before. And as its price fell, most people's interest waned, but not that of finance professionals who can make money when assets increase or decrease in value.
As of this writing, cryptocurrencies generally â and bitcoin specifically â were being traded by the likes of venture capital firms (with boosters like Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz), hedge funds, mysterious bitcoin 'whales,' and mainstream investors like George Soros. Goldman Sachs, in particular, has reportedly considered entering the space. Pending exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could let investors trade cryptocurrencies like stocks, tying digital currencies ever closer to the system they were initially meant to replace.
Outside of the financial community, bitcoin's unexpected popularity has come with a cost. So many people are mining bitcoin that the powerful chips used by scientists have doubled in price, making it more difficult for astronomers, among others, to do their jobs. Bitcoin mining also consumes a lot of energy and produces a lot of emissions, which is making climate hawks nervous.
No one has discovered who Satoshi Nakamoto was or is, though many have tried. There have been several pretenders to the crown, but no one has ever provided the definitive proof: trading Nakamoto's bitcoin. The crisis in confidence in the banking system appears to have passed. But the biggest winners from the new bitcoin era may very well be the people the system was designed to bypass: institutional investors and banks.

Federal Reserve Blames Altcoins for Dragging Down the Bitcoin Price,P. H.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has released an article today about Bitcoin. In it, the bank notes that the price of Bitcoin has three potential futures: indefinite, infinite appreciation; zero; or somewhere in between. They believe it will be somewhere in between.

The authors, David Andolfatto and Andrew Spewak, conclude that one of the factors dragging down the price of Bitcoin is an ever-expanding supply of alternatives. Bitcoin is an inherently speculative and volatile asset. A fixed supply doesn't mean an ever-increasing value. Demand determines value, after all. Other tokens are frequently launched which have properties attractive to a portion of the market. If Bitcoin was still the only cryptocurrency, something which was only the case for a very brief time in its history, this money would probably go into Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Maximalists Ignore Important Realities

However, the Bitcoin maximalist argument that Bitcoin will simply usurp any improvements by other tokens has never come to fruition. There are even fewer dApps and users of dApps via Bitcoin's blockchain than much later entrants like Tron.

The Federal Reserve economists write:

Consider the following thought experiment. A restaurant selling meals for $10 will happily accept payment in the form of one Hamilton bill ($10) or two Lincoln bills ($5). That is, the nominal exchange rate between Hamilton and Lincoln bills is 2:1. Now, suppose that the supply of Lincoln bills is increased but the supply of Hamilton bills remains the same. The exchange rate remains unaffected [â¦] That is, the increase in the supply of Lincoln bills has led to a decline in the purchasing power of both Lincoln bills and Hamilton bills, even though the supply of Hamilton bills has remained fixed. Might an expansion in the supply of Altcoin have a similar depressing effect on the price of Bitcoin?

There are other complicating factors to the price of Bitcoin. On the one hand, it is the cryptocurrency with superior liquidity. This makes it the on-ramp and off-ramp for many other cryptocurrencies. Does anyone remember when ICOs were primarily conducted for Bitcoin? Nowadays Ethereum performs that function. Importantly, ICOs fueled demand for Ethereum through 2017 and 2018. Ethereum has a large supply and may never stop producing new units. Therefore, its lower values make sense: the more available something is, the less value it is.

Story continues

Federal Reserve on the Intrinsic Value of Cryptocurrencies

The article also speaks to 'intrinsic value.'

Consider now the bearish case for Bitcoin. This outlook is based on the view that Bitcoin has no fundamental value and that sooner or later the market will recognize this fact. In our view, one can accept that Bitcoin trades above its fundamental value without claiming that its fundamental value is zero. In fact, many securities trade above what might be considered their fundamental value. Gold, for example, trades above its value as measured by its industrial applications.

As noted before, Bitcoin's actual utility is a secure digital store of value and transfer of the same. Other blockchains have taken and dominated the 'blockchain' aspect of cryptocurrency. Despite the global chaos, demand for cryptographically secure payment systems isn't necessarily popping. But it is feasible that people will come into contact with blockchain technologies through banking applications as well as other decentralized applications. Such things will generate demand for tokens that underpin those blockchains. Tokens like Ethereum, TRON, NEO, Aelf have a long-term technical proposition that Bitcoin has long been lagging on.

Smart Contracts Change The World

Bitcoin as a smart contract platform is probably a dream at this point. For one thing, it's significantly more expensive to use. For another, at this point, other platforms simply do it better. The trend of alternatives taking up more and more of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is likely to continue. Bitcoin maximalists rest on flawed arguments such as 'network effect.' These arguments conveniently ignore historical examples where superior technology and marketing overtook dominant networks.

Bitcoin is likely not to trend downwards toward zero. The economists acknowledge this as well. But the odds are that an increasing amount of cryptocurrency market capitalization will enter through and be invested in alternatives with growing demand based on their usefulness.

After ten years, Bitcoin remains more a speculative asset and store of value than anything. The trend the Federal Reserve economists identify is representative of that. There are numerous factors that go into an actual downturn in the price of Bitcoin. A good percentage of holders will not sell at a loss. Another good percentage will not sell at all. These people hold the coin's price at a certain level. But active trading can eventually reduce the price without regard to these people's philosophical or strategic holding patterns.

No One Knows the Actual Value of Bitcoin

bitcoin price

Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies very much remain in a price discovery phase. Some believe Bitcoin was overbought in the hype bubble of 2017, which inherently raised the price of nearly every other crypto available. Others believe it was just a fluke. Institutional money is still only just entering the picture. The utility of Bitcoin is only one aspect of its value, but it will play an increasingly important role as others develop more advanced and attractive feature sets.

As the Federal Reserve economists said:

We think the future price path is more likely to remain bounded between these two extremes.

Zero? No. Endless incline without significant change to the demand climate? Certainly not. Look out, Bitcoin. The 2000s called and they want their basic crypto design back. The era of smart contracts is dawning. Whoever does it best will see the most demand. It's probably that simple.

Over the last 48 hours, the Bitcoin price increased from $3,629 to $3,890, by more than seven percent.

The Ethereum price has also surged by 19 percent since January 2 from $143 to $160, recording a substantial increase in value prior to its highly anticipated Constantinople hard fork.

Not a Bad Year For Bitcoin

Bitcoin ended 2018 with an 80 percent drop in its price from its all-time high at $19,500. However, Jameson Lopp, the chief technical officer at Casa and a former BitGo executive, has said based on several metrics, it can be argued that Bitcoin has performed relatively well.

In terms of scalability, the growth of nodes, hash rate, influence in academics, and daily volume, Bitcoin recorded a significant improvement from early 2018. Lopp said:

A couple things are clear: 2018 was the worst year for Bitcoin. Also, 2018 was the best year for Bitcoin. It just depends upon which metrics you're focused.

The Casa executive noted that despite the fall in the price of Bitcoin, the number of reachable nodes has not fallen by a large margin, suggesting that individuals are using Bitcoin nodes for economic purposes and will not suspend them in the short-term.

With academic interest in Bitcoin growing rapidly and the amount of venture capital investment steadily increasing as well, he said:

Yes, Bitcoin fared poorly in terms of exchange rate in 2018. But by almost any other metric the system is improving and growing. Those of us who are dedicated to this system shall continue to BUIDL and add value; we have no control over the market but I expect that it will catch up to us sooner or later.

In the cryptocurrency market, the value of crypto assets move by cycles, and it is minimally affected by developments in the industry.

As the industry establishes the foundation for the next wave of investors and users in the cryptocurrency ecosystems, analysts believe the price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies will follow.

Can the Momentum of Crypto Assets be Sustained?

ethereum wallet dapp cryptocurrency

Digital assets in the likes of Ethereum, EOS, and Bitcoin Cash have recorded large gains over the past week, with Ethereum increasing by over 19 percent in a 24-hour span against the U.S. dollar to take over Ripple (XRP).

Story continues

Ethereum could continue to see an increase in its price over the long run, considering that the Constantinople hard fork is similar to the halvening of Bitcoin's block reward in the sense that it decreases the potential supply in circulation of ETH throughout the months to come.

But, there still remains questions on whether the recent recovery of crypto assets could result in the end of a bear market for digital assets.

As of January 3, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market remains $90 billion down from November, and it has to increase by 69 percent to recover to November levels.

Until crypto assets reach a valuation of over $300 billion, it is not possible to conclusively state that the bear market of cryptocurrencies has come to an end.

What Bitcoin Mining Will Look Like In 2019,Eric Hamilton,2019-01-26 14:55:00,full,https://www.techtimes.com/brandspin/237987/20190126/what-bitcoin-mining-will-look-like-in-2019.htm,techtimes.com,"What Bitcoin Mining Will Look Like In 2019 A new year brings with it new changes to the marketplace and 2019 is set to disrupt the cryptocurrency market, thanks to innovations in Bitcoin mining.","Eric Hamilton, Tech Times 26 January 2019, 09:01 am (Photo : Flickr | Cypto360) A new year brings with it new changes to the marketplace and 2019 is set to disrupt the cryptocurrency market, thanks to innovations in Bitcoin mining. Despite the fact that the world's greatest cryptocurrency has tumbled from its all-time high, crypto enthusiasts everywhere are still betting big on Bitcoin's long-term success by throwing their weight behind mining operations that could one day turn a huge profit. Before cryptocurrency investors or enthusiasts anywhere can wrap their heads around Bitcoin mining, however, they need to understand the changes to the practice that 2019 will bring. Here's what Bitcoin mining will look like in 2019, and how it's set to change in the near future. As time goes on, it's only natural that technology improves, proliferates, and becomes cheaper, and nowhere in the market is this truer than in the cryptocurrency industry. Countless technical innovations have buoyed cryptocurrency markets for years now, and 2019 will be no different, especially that mining rigs are about to become more efficient than ever before. The research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors recently noted that improvements in Bitcoin mining couldÂ drastically bolsterÂ the cryptocurrency's price by the end of the year, though their high estimate is bullish compared to most. Regardless of whether you buy into Fundstrat's claim that the more efficient rigs Bitcoin miners are utilizing today will buoy prices when you can see on Luno, it's indisputable that the technology driving cryptocurrencies forward is perpetually getting better and better. Blockchain technology and popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have become more than mere trends in the market, having accrued sizable amounts of momentum and financial interest behind them. With Bitcoin's price dipping, however, miners everywhere are still worried about their long-term prospects. With miners shutting down their hardware and pulling out of networks for want of profit, it's reasonable to assume that 2019 could mark a downturn in Bitcoin mining overall. Miners may find it difficult to break even, for instance, despite the fact that contemporary rigs are oftentimes more powerful than we could have dreamed of even just a few years ago. With mining monopolies beginning to dwindle, however, there's a strong argument to be made that Bitcoin mining is about to enter a new, more positive era. A New Era Of Bitcoin Mining Is Here One of the defining trends of the cryptocurrency market in 2019 will be the fact that Bitcoin monopolies are slowly crumbling away. Bitcoin mining as a whole is becomingÂ vastly decentralizedÂ as big players in the market who once held the reins of power are now finding it hard to prevent newcomers from hedging in on their turf. As technology becomes cheaper and knowhow surrounding cryptocurrency mining continues to proliferate, expect it to become harder for existing monopolies to maintain their hold on power as the market slowly but surely expands. If Bitcoin's overall price keeps dropping, however, new miners will find it increasingly hard to turn a profit; the digital token's rapid depreciation has made it arguablyÂ downright impossibleÂ to turn a profit on a mining operation, according to some sources. The energy-intensive mining process continues to be publicly unpalatable, too, with many headlines boasting that the creation process for cryptocurrencies is too wasteful to stomach. Whether the claims surrounding Bitcoin mining are legitimate or not doesn't matter, as the public will likely shy away from the process regardless of the validity of the claims. As time goes on, expect Bitcoin monopolies to fade, but don't expect it to single-handedly revitalize the mining process. Modern Bitcoin mining is simply too hazardous for many, with the incentivizing profits that once lured newcomers to the market now has vanished. Unless Bitcoin's price sizably inflates over the course of 2019, expect the overall mining industry to continue its steady struggle to break even. â 2022 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

ElectrumSV is a conversion - for the Bitcoin SV blockchain - of the popular Electrum wallet for Bitcoin. ElectrumSV version 1.0.0 is available at electrumsv.io and is provided for free usage under the open source MIT license. (Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/807147/ElectrumSV_Wallet_Logo.jpg )The original Electrum wallet was created for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain, and is considered one of the top Bitcoin wallets because of its strong technical feature set. After the August 2017 hard fork which created Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a BCH version of Electrum was created under the name ""Electron Cash"".More recently, the November 15, 2018 hard fork of BCH led to BSV emerging as its own chain and token, dedicated to preserve Bitcoin's original design. Named for the ""Satoshi Vision"" of Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin SV's mission is focused: restore the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable, and allow it to massively scale.This led developers Roger Taylor and Neil Booth to create a new version of the Electrum wallet dedicated to BSV. Roger and Neil were two productive developers of the Electron Cash version of Electrum. Neil also created the ElectrumX server software which is used almost exclusively by all Electrum-based wallets. However, finding no future on the Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCH/BAB) chain, they decided to create and release the ElectrumSV wallet for the BSV chain. As they explain on the ElectrumSV.io website: "" Bitcoin SV is the only Bitcoin that follows the whitepaper and values being stable and non-experimental, ElectrumSV naturally builds on it.""ElectrumSV will focus on being a desktop wallet, leaving mobile wallet development to other BSV ventures such as Centbee, HandCash and Cashpay. Because it based on both the Electrum and Electron Cash wallets, the ElectrumSV feature set includes:an advanced interface allowing flexible importing of private keys from other wallets;integration with hardware wallets such as Bitbox, Ledger and Keepkey; andmanagement of wallet keys and historical transactions. Given their more advanced feature set, the Electrum family of wallets (including Electron Cash) are known to be more suited to developers than consumer users. The ElectrumSV team intends to keep and extend the advanced feature set and flexible functionality inherited from Electrum, but will improve functions to be more user-friendly for the ordinary Bitcoin consumer.ElectrumSV's user-friendly approach begins immediately with a key feature in the first release: a coin splitting tool to allow users to easily and safely split their pre-fork BCH coins into BSV coins. This addresses a common request from users since the November 2018 BCH hard fork which led to Bitcoin SV's emergence.Roger Taylor and Neil Booth remark:""We agree with the Bitcoin SV message that it's time for Bitcoin to grow up, keep a stable protocol without constant developer experimentation, and move to its next phase for scaling and mass adoption. ElectrumSV is contributing to that effort by leaving behind the developer-focused experience, and making a wallet with easy-to-use features for everyone. We intend to continue making more improvements for the future.""Work on the ElectrumSV project is supported by the bComm Association, the first-ever organization dedicated to bCommerce (Bitcoin commerce) which brings together developers, merchants, exchanges, miners and other Bitcoin network participants. The bComm Association supports Bitcoin SV as the only stable, scalable blockchain that can achieve a world of bCommerce.nChain, the blockchain research & development firm, and its Bitcoin SV Node team also assisted the ElectrumSV developers. nChain's Jimmy Nguyen, Founding President of the bComm Association, remarks:""We are thrilled to help Roger and Neil bring the strong legacy of the Electrum wallet to Bitcoin SV. The ElectrumSV team understands that Bitcoin is for everyone, not just for developers. That is why their approach to upgrade Electrum into a more user-friendly wallet for BSV is critical to help achieve the Satoshi Vision - a world where billions of people globally use Bitcoin every day.""Contact detailsEd Pownalled@pownall.eu+44-7825-064776",finanznachrichten.de,8207,news,DE,en,Pr Newswire,https://fns1.de/g/fb.png,False,,12.561851,34ece6e659a3dfe02703868fa5957187

By CCN.com: A report by JPMorgan suggests that for over four weeks during the fourth quarter, bitcoin's market price was lower than its mining costs on average.

According to the JPMorgan analysts, the cost of mining bitcoin during Q4 was averaging about $4,060 around the world, Bloomberg reports. According to them, starting late November when the price of bitcoin went below $4,000, it became uneconomical to mine bitcoin.

Bitcoin Price Still Below the Globe's Average Cost of Mining

Currently, bitcoin is trading at around the $3,650 level after falling off the $3,700 resistance level which it touched earlier.

Bitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury Sechet took to Twitter recently, proclaiming that the new BCH-powered alias-address system Cashaccount will be a privacy disaster. Surprisingly, Cashaccount creator Jonathan Silverblood agreed withÂ Sechet, as the founder believes his project will lead to more BCH users reusing Bitcoin addresses. This would be bad for privacy, as reused addresses can be used to discover financial information that users may not wish to disclose.

I agree â it will undoubtedly increase the number of people that will reuse addresses.
Perhaps you can spend some time and help get those stealth keys that @ChrisPacia was working on more widely supported, or help progress the BIP-47 support?
â Jonathan Silverblood (@monsterbitar) January 3, 2019 To resolve the potential lack of privacy, Silverblood asked Sechet to collaborate with Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia on stealth keys, or to assist with the development of BIP-47.
However, other commentators likeÂ Crypto PelÃ© were not as concerned with a lack of privacy. PelÃ© pointed out that some BCH users are fine with the transparency that comes with reusing addresses.
Erik Voorhees Defends Brian Armstrong From Criticism
To commemorate Bitcoin's 10th year anniversary of the Genesis Block, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted a series of tweets reminiscing how he first got into bitcoin.

â Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) January 3, 2019 In the thread, Armstrong recounts reading the Bitcoin white paper in 2010 and becoming obsessed about Bitcoin for the subsequent 6 months. He began building a bitcoin wallet for Android devices as a side project, but then pivoted to a hosted wallet and a custom Bitcoin node. After securing funding from Ycombinator, Armstrong started working on his business idea full time and settled on the company name Coinbase. He then ended the tweet-storm on a positive note, boldly proclaiming that he has 'never had more conviction' on the future of cryptocurrencies.
Not everyone responded positively to Armstrong's tweets. Commentator Simon Moon called Armstrong out for being a fake libertarian, arguing that Coinbase is a government-backed monopoly.

Hahâ¦ as if their business just 'appeared' and had a moat of regulation around it. The regulation isn't their fault, and they have to walk a very delicate line. Yet millions enter the ecosystem because of the tools (read: bridge) that CoinBase has built.

After showing signs of life earlier this month, Bitcoin has fallen back toward its lowest levels since mid-2017, and many investors have moved on to promising investing themes in other areas.
Many proponents of crypto investing have argued that once mainstream investors had a familiar, reliable way to invest in bitcoin, such as an exchange-traded fund tied to the cryptocurrency, prices would rebound. Yet long-awaited bitcoin ETFs have yet to emerge, with a host of issues having prevented them from reaching the financial markets. The latest obstacle came in the form of the partial government shutdown, and it just led to the withdrawal of the final remaining bitcoin ETF proposal before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Many now believe that it could a year or more before a bitcoin ETF tries to move forward again -- and more skeptical investors think that the shutdown might just have eliminated any chance that bitcoin ETFs will ever get onto major U.S. stock exchanges.

The last bitcoin ETF proposal standing just got pulled
On Jan. 22, the Cboe BZX Exchange withdrew a proposed rule change that would have allowed it to list and trade shares of the SolidX Bitcoin Shares ETF, to be issued by the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust. Cboe BZX had filed the proposed rule change back in June 2018, but the SEC asked for more time in August to consider the proposal. After some minimal action in September, the SEC again delayed consideration in early December.
Those following the proposal noted that the SEC had until late February to make a final decision on the filing. The problem, though, is that the government shutdown has suspended most nonessential operations at the SEC, including the review of proposed rule changes like Cboe BZX's.
VanEck is still interested in pursuing the bitcoin ETF, having referred to the withdrawal of the application as temporary. The fund manager's CEO said in a CNBC interview that VanEck had been discussing various issues surrounding the proposed crypto fund with regulators, but the shutdown put an end to those discussions. With outstanding issues including addressing custody of cryptocurrency held by the ETF and the risks of market manipulation, VanEck chose to withdraw the application with the intent of refiling once government operations return to normal and the SEC has had a chance to catch up.
Holding still on bitcoin ETFs
The move left the SEC with no active bitcoin ETF proposals pending. It's the first time since 2017 that that's been the case, and it doesn't look as if that state of affairs is likely to change soon -- for a couple of reasons.
On one hand, those who want to file brand-new applications for bitcoin ETFs see little reason to do so while the shutdown is ongoing. Without any reasonable expectation for action, starting the timeline is only asking for a curt denial if the SEC doesn't end up having time or resources to consider an application fully.
Meanwhile, there are several bitcoin ETF proposals that have already been rejected by SEC staff members but are pending review from the full commission. The same deadlines for initial consideration don't apply to review requests following a rejection, and no reviews will happen as long as the shutdown lasts.
What it'll take for a bitcoin ETF to go live
Pessimists think that the latest setback could prove to be the death knell for bitcoin ETFs, but others see more reason for hope. In some ways, the poor performance in the cryptocurrency markets is a good thing, as it will give evidence that the SEC can use in assessing how bitcoin behaves under conditions other than the euphoric rush that prompted many ETF filings in the first place. If bitcoin avoids market manipulation and if participants in the crypto markets can come up with ways to ensure trading liquidity and secure custody, then the SEC might well be satisfied enough to allow a bitcoin ETF in the future.
Given how much interest there remains in cryptocurrencies despite their price slump, attempts to get bitcoin ETFs approved aren't likely to cease forever. But it remains unclear whether any will get approved, and for now, all plans for investors to have access to bitcoin via an ETF remain on hold.

Bitwise Asset Management, a provider of cryptocurrency indexes and funds, is looking to change that.What To KnowIn 2018, ETF industry observers and crypto market fans were tantalized by the prospects of a U.S.-listed bitcoin ETF coming to market only to be rebuffed by the Securities and Exchange Commission at every turn.Last year, the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets turned back applications for bitcoin-related ETFs from issuers such as ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares. The commission also delayed a decision on an institutionally-focused bitcoin ETF from VanEck and fintech firm SolidX.While it remains to be seen how the SEC rules on the VanEck/SolidX product, previous decision delays on bitcoin ETFs have ultimately led to outright rejections by the SEC.Why It's ImportantAfter watching rival fund issuers try and fail to bring bitcoin ETFs to market last year, San Francisco-based Bitwise Asset Management believes it can avoid a similar fate with the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF and provide the SEC with the data and information the commission needs to potentially (and finally) make a positive decision on a bitcoin ETF.Bitwise announced Thursday 'that it has filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) relating to a new proposed physically held bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF),' according to a statement issued by the company.Bitwise is an established player in the cryptocurrency index fund space. Last year, the asset manager partnered with Morgan Creek Digital, the digital assets unit of Morgan Creek Capital Management, to launch the Digital Asset Index Fund. That product was developed for institutional investors and high net worth individual investors.Bitwise's proposed bitcoin ETF has important differences relative to previously proposed, competing efforts.'The proposed ETF differs from previously filed proposed bitcoin ETFs in that it will rely on regulated third party custodians to hold its physical bitcoin, and in that the index draws prices from a large number ofÂ cryptocurrency exchanges, representing the majority of currently verifiable bitcoin trading,' said the company.What's NextIf the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF is approved, it will traded on the New York Stock Exchange and it's expected that the exchange operator will soon file plans with the SEC for a proposed rule change that would pave the way for the fund to trade on the largest U.S. exchange.'Bitwise expects the NYSE to file a so-called 'Rule 19b-4' request with the SEC in the coming days requesting necessary NYSE rule changes in order to allow its application to be approved and the ETF to list once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC,' according to the Bitwise statement.Related LinksLeveraging Up Latin AmericaSeize Shareholder Yield With This ETF",benzinga.com,1933,news,US,en,"Benzinga Staff Writer,ETF Professor",https://www.benzinga.com/next-assets/images/safari-pinned-tab.svg,False,@benzinga,12.552806,9de1ac7f716f0ff8b399b9e26df7076c

By CCN.com: On January 22, in a steep a sell-off, the Bitcoin price dropped from $3,615 to $3,401 by around six percent on the day.

Although a continuous fall below the $3,400 mark could have led to an extended sell-off throughout January, traders have said that the rebound of Bitcoin from a key support level could allow the asset to recover in the upcoming days.

Not Bullish But Not Bearish For Bitcoin

Since December 2018, the Bitcoin price has shown a high level of volatility in a low and tight price range. In the grand scheme of things, Bitcoin has shown stability in a range from $3,500 to $4,000 and has been unable to break out of or drop below key resistance or support levels.

Bitcoin Price Celebrates New Year Inside a Near-Term Descending Channel,Yashu Gola,2019-01-01 21:30:55,full,https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-price-celebrates-inside-near-213055698.html,yahoo.com,"Bitcoin price on January 1st saw a minor decline of less than 1 percent against the US Dollar on a 24-hour adjusted timeframe. The digital currency, which established a weekly high towards $4,239â¦","Bitcoin price on January 1st saw a minor decline of less than 1 percent against the US Dollar on a 24-hour adjusted timeframe.

The digital currency, which established a weekly high towards $4,239 ahead of Christmas, corrected to as low as $3,561 on Coinbase in later days. It attempted a minor bull run on December 28 but fell just short of $4,000 in absence of adequate bullish sentiment and trading volume â probably because of the New Year break. The first day of the year is now seeing Bitcoin consolidating inside an interim falling channel, awaiting breakout as it maintains the downside pressure.

The bitcoin price, according to the Coinbase chart above, is finding it difficult to excite traders into placing long positions around certain high highs. The area between $4,000 and $4,239 continues to reject bitcoin rallies from flourishing into anything substantial, and it seems that bitcoin could at last form a double bottom towards $3,129 should the market conditions don't change.

As of now, bitcoin is setting its downside targets towards $3,577 for a potential bounce back. A breakdown from there, and bitcoin would be forced to find fresh support levels towards $3,434 and $3,297. To the upside, the digital currency will need to invalidate bearish sentiment in $4,000-4,239 area before setting higher bullish targets.

Focus on Fundamentals

The retail market could be looking forward to the launch of Bakkt, an ICE-backed bitcoin futures exchange, at the end of this January. It is evident that big players are keeping their distance from the market as of now and small retail action cannot bring the bullish makeover sought by every bitcoin holder. Bakkt could be a strong catalyst to at least drive the bitcoin value towards $5,000, if not further.

The macroeconomic fundamentals are somewhat supporting bitcoin as well, with the dollar value heading into a negative territory owing to the drop in rate hike expectations. Investors are likely to go look for safe havens. It does not necessarily mean that every investor will hedge into bitcoin â especially when a more trustworthy Japanese Yen is around the corner â but a little push from the mainstream investors' front would be adequate to frame bitcoin in more bullish terms.

Story continues

Intraday Targets

We are treating the descending parallel channel as our hint to place breakout positions inside a range defined by $3,841 as interim resistance and $3,577 as interim support. Therefore, a break above the upper trendline would have us open a long order towards $3,841 while a stop loss just 1-pip below the entry point will maintain our risk management strategy.

Our prevailing bearish sentiment has had us enter a short position towards $3,577, a position that is still active. We have placed a stop loss order just near $3,755 to minimize our losses in case bitcoin breaks out to the upside.

Trade safe and a happy new year.

Read this Term.'The MTA defines âmoney' as âcurrency or legal tender or any other product that is generally recognized as a medium of exchange.' Additionally, Pennsylvania law has defined money as âlawful money of the United States' and a medium of exchange currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government,' DoBS noted.Keep Reading The act specifically mentions only fiat currency as âmoney' and United States government does not consider Â BitcoinÂ  Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.Â No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.Â In fact, we've gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo HanyeczÂ made BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John's.One could now argue that Bitcoin has now a global brand because of how everyone recognizes it even if they don't really know what it is.Added to that, Bitcoin also has the largest market cap and liquidity pool which is why many find it to be the most attractive coin out there.Â Bitcoin summed upÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency operating with no type of central control nor oversight from banks or governments, relying solely on its cryptography and peer-to-peer software.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â A public ledger keeps track of all transactions by recording them. Copies are then held around the world on servers called nodes (which anyone can set up) and consensus is thus achieved on the state of the network.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Every single transaction is broadcasted publicly to the network and then shared between nodes. Miners lump these together into groups called blocks and add them permanently to the blockchain, Bitcoin's definitive account book.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â May 22 is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking the anniversary of BTC's first official commercial transaction with a real companyHow Does Bitcoin Work?Â Bitcoin is a completely neutral and decentralized asset which means no one is controlling it (no bankers or oligarchs pulling strings behind the curtain), and no central entity can issue or back it.Â Nonetheless, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender in El Salvador and as it makes its way into our every day lives, other countries might soon follow suit.Â Bitcoin uses cryptography to assure its safety and reliability.Â Â Bitcoin transactions are verified by a process called mining which basically runs on computing power to solveÂ mathematical puzzles. When trading Bitcoin its name is often abbreviated as BTC.Â What is a BlockchainÂ Bitcoin's system can be described as a group of computers (often called miners or nodes) which stores the Bitcoin blockchain and runs the Bitcoin code.Â Â The blockchain itself can be visualized as a string of blocks and within every block one can find immutable information, usually a collection of transactions, that are permanently recorded and which everyone can look into.Â Given that all of the Bitcoin network's computers are running the exact same list of blocks, participants are assured of the process transparency because the ledger is maintained safely in this decentralized database.Â This makes it so that no trusted third party is necessary, and no single person is in control, rather all network participants are.Â Â As new information comes along, a freshly added block is minted and added to the blockchain while other nodes verify the whole thing.Â P2P ExplainedÂ Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is meant to make instant payments easier. Bitcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement P2P and its system shifts the responsibility of processing the blockchain transactions to Bitcoin miners while giving them rewards for doing so.Â Bitcoin miners act as a decentralized authority which enforces the Bitcoin network's credibility by performing these tasks and maintaining the Bitcoin ledger.Â Â The best-known case for the success of peer-to-peer BTC transactions probably lies in countries like Venezuela and El Salvador in which the younger generations have made strides in the coin's mass adoption in their respective countries.Â Â How Does Bitcoin Make Money?Â Many people are still purchasing Bitcoins for the asset's investment value rather than its capabilities of being used as a medium of exchange. As such, the asset has a speculative side which cannot be ignored due to how it correlates with its price volatility.Â How To Get Bitcoin?Â How to get into Bitcoin is a fairly easy process. Aside from the Bitcoin mining process, the asset can be exchanged for standard currencies even though it is not backed by any form of government or central entity like a bank.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Bitcoin exchange rate against the US Dollar keeps attracting investors and traders.Â Â Luckily, even the uninitiated won't be needing a 'bitcoin for dummies' guide because the asset is normally bought through a Bitcoin exchangeÂ to which you can wire money or simply pay with your credit card.Â Just remember to look for BTC (BTC meaning is obviously Bitcoin but there are altcoins which might try to pose as the original).Â Bitcoin Mining: How Are Bitcoins Created?Â Bitcoins are created through a process which is open for everyone to participate known as Bitcoin mining.Â Bitcoin mining consists of solving mathematical puzzles by means of one's computational power, meaning that mining systems will in fact compete with one another for the asset.Â Â How Do I Start Mining Bitcoin?Â Even though the bitcoin digital world welcomes all with open arms, mining new bitcoins isn't really a Bitcoin for beginners type of thing.Â If you want to venture into mining Bitcoins, the most obvious entry barriers are the expensive ASIC systems which you will need and the high electrical bills they will run up.Â ASIC stands for application-specific integrated chip. Bitcoin ASIC systems are custom bitcoin mining machines and are unquestionably one of the largest investments for bitcoin miners given that prices start at 4 figures and miners organize thousands of these into their mining pools (one ASIC system alone will potentially generate less than one single bitcoin).Â Network infrastructure may also be an issue as miners will need uninterrupted internet access with the least possible latency. The Bitcoin mining process has thus turned into a costly endeavor with no guaranteed results.Â Bitcoin Security ExplainedÂ Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which is distributed in a peer-to-peer network, making it very resistant to censorship and confiscation.Â Bitcoin technology boasts its safety by relying on several factors such as its blockchain, the fact that it is cryptographic, decentralized, and permissionless.Â Being public and decentralized boosts the asset's security as nodes verify every transaction and maintain the ledger.Â As such, theoretically, one would need to control over half of all the nodes to be able to manipulate it, something which albeit not impossible is certainly highly unlikely.Â How To Use BitcoinÂ Bitcoin has been growing at a steady pace and some brick-and-mortar merchants have begun to accept it as means of payment for goods and services.Â Online, the asset has also found its way as an accepted online payment option on pair with credit cards or Paypal.Â How to Buy BitcoinÂ Buying Bitcoin is a straightforward process. A buyer will simply need to pick a broker, opt for a paying option (wiring money, credit card, etc.), place an order, and select a safe storage option for his or her coins.Â Keep in mind that you sh",financemagnates.com,9184,news,IL,en,Arnab Shome,https://www.financemagnates.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/american-flag-1.jpg,False,@financemagnates,12.537472,d7ddf6517bbd395458348107f2d3b60a

In that part of the galaxy, interstellar money is entirely cryptocurrency which goes by the name of 'bitcoin'. If so, is that an indication that cryptocurrencies will reign in future?Â  Bitcoin is the most disruptive invention since the internet. I believe, cryptocurrencies like bitcoins could be the future of our global economic system. It would be like having our bank in our mobile phones. Â We wouldn't need banks and third-parties, we would be able to send money around the world without worrying about governments, exchange rates and other problems inherent in our current financial world. Many today want to escape a banking system that they feel is dishonest and inherently unfair. Bitcoins could well be the answer.Â  Cryptocurrencies are recent in origin. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency. It was invented in 2009, by a mysterious person or a bunch of persons making use of the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Â It was released as an open-source software which could be sent from user-to-user on the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network without the need for go-betweens.Â  In 2010, the first known business transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. After early testing of transactions, the first significant users of bitcoin were dark-net markets, such as Silk Road.Â  Jordan Kelley, the founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on February 20, 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas is similar to bank ATMs. A cafe in London installed the country's first Bitcoin ATM which takes the money and dispenses Bitcoin which is then used to buy cakes and coffees. Â A Boston-based online restaurant 'Foodler', accepts payments in bitcoins, and is doing about $15,000 in Bitcoin food orders per month. Bitcoins get created or are 'mined' by cracking outrageously complicated mathematical equations, requiring immense computing power as a reward for a process known as mining.Â  Cryptocurrencies adopt different approaches when it comes to managing supply, but many of the popular ones, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are 'mined' only up to a fixed number. For example, just twenty-one million Bitcoins can ever be mined; nearly seventeen million have been so far.Â  Cryptocurrency users send funds anywhere in the world like emails between wallet addresses on the blockchain without any transaction fees. Imagine two users, Ram and Sunil. If Ram wants to send one Bitcoin to Sunil, he must know the address of Sunil's Bitcoin wallet. Ram then uses his private key to securely sign a transaction containing Sunil's wallet address and the amount to be transferred. Ram then sends the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network, where it is confirmed across the blockchain by 'miners' and recorded into a transaction 'block.' Once this occurs, the transaction is complete. Â Anytime a transaction takes place; it is recorded forever in a public ledger known as the 'blockchain,' which ensures no duplicate transactions are permitted.Â  The majority of the people purchase Bitcoins on external exchanges with conventional currencies, such as dollars or euros, or with plastic money. The exchange rates against the dollar for Bitcoin oscillate wildly. Â For example, the price of a single Bitcoin was just a few U.S. dollars in 2012, but it spiked to more than $19,000 in December 2017, thereby making Bitcoin a big speculative asset.Â  FBI owns the single largest Bitcoin wallet on the internet. After the FBI brought down the darknet market Silk Road, it started seizing bitcoins belonging to the Dread Pirate Roberts - the operator of the darknet marketplace, an American man by the real name of Ross Ulbricht. The FBI now controls more than 144,000 bitcoins that reside at a bitcoin address which are worth close to $100 million.Â  Cryptocurrencies by facilitating a digital and anonymous payment mechanism have eased the way for the growth of âdarknet' marketplaces in which illegal goods and services are traded.Â  It has also created significant regulatory challenges, including the use of cryptocurrencies in black markets of drugs, hacks and thefts, illicit pornography, even murder-for-hire, including it's potential to fund terrorism, launder money, and avoid capital controls. It's been noticed that illegal activity accounts for a substantial proportion of the users and trading activity in bitcoin. For example, approximately one-quarter of all users (25%) and close to one-half of bitcoin transactions (44%) are associated with illegal activity.Â  The estimated 24 million bitcoin market participants that use bitcoin primarily for unlawful purposes as on April 2017, annually conduct around 36 million transactions, with a value of about $72 billion, and collectively hold approximately $8 billion worth of bitcoin.Â  The cryptocurrencies could be used to finance terrorism if it is not counteracted effectively. Â Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer for anti-virus vendor F-Secure, based in Helsinki, Finland, cautions that the Islamic State, better known as ISIS or ISIL, could get funded, to some extent by bitcoins. Â 'ISIS also operates sites in the deep Web - Tor hidden services - that are appealing for donations for the Islamic State in bitcoins.' In 2016, an Islamic State-associated Darknet site called Isdarat, accessible through The Onion Router (Tor) browser, was discovered to have sought bitcoin donations from supporters.Â  In June 2015, a US court convicted Shukri Amin, a 17-year-old from Virginia, for providing monetary support to IS. Amin was accused of assisting Islamic State supporters by encouraging people to donate bitcoins to the group through social media platforms. In 2014, reports of Islamic State fighters in Raqqa, Syria using bitcoins for international transactions and for making small or domestic purchases in money transfer offices surfaced. In December 2017, a woman was arrested in New York for procuring $62,000 in bitcoin to send to Islamic State.Â  Although Bitcoin makes it possible to exchange money without anyone knowing who is sending or receiving it, it's possible to track how the cash flows through blockchain as well as other transactions, once someone understands the bitcoin address of the person he is paying.Â  This is because all the transactions are recorded on the blockchain. That may be the reason why bitcoin is becoming less popular with criminals as law enforcement units are getting better at tracking large amounts of the currency linked to criminal activity. Besides, tracking illicit digital transaction has become easy today with 'Chainalysis' cryptocurrency investigation software which helps law enforcement and financial institutions identify and stop bad actors who are using cryptocurrencies for illegal activity such as fraud, extortion, and money laundering. The software enables police to track the delivery points of ransom payments and identify criminals withdrawing their illegally procured funds at an exchange.Â  Three researchers at the University of Luxembourg have disclosed that they have identified techniques that can be readily used to verify the identity of anonymous Bitcoin users for between 11 percent and 60 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. Deanonymising a Bitcoin user means linking their nom de plume - which serves as a public key - to the IP address from which they trade bitcoins. To achieve this, the researchers have informed that they only require $2,000 worth of equipment.Â  The researchers also say they can defeat users who endeavour to disappear behind firewalls or network address translation. The researchers say they can also unmask up to 60 per cent of Bitcoin users who employ the Tor anonymising network to mask their IP address. The deanonymizing method opens up new ways for law enforcement agencies to tie transactions to an IP address, and perhaps back to the identity of a criminal.Â  Beyond cryptocurrencies, there are numerous other forms of digital payments such as Liberty Reserve, E-gold, and WebMoney. Liberty Reserve, inÂ  particular, was accused of laundering more than $6 billion for several years, according to federal prosecutors.Â  Known as the PayPal for criminals,' with no personal account details required, Liberty Reserve facilitated a broad range of criminal activities across the Darknet, including 'credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and near- narcotics trafficking.' Â It is also believed to have played the central part, in stealing $45 million from thousands of ATMs in 24 countries in December 2012 and February 2013.Â  Though Liberty Reserve, like Silk Road, was ultimately brought down by the FBI and its founder arrested, many competitors have burgeoned out in its place. The competitors promise not just pseudonymity but also completely untraceable anonymity. One such new currency, Darkcoin, has been created specifically to confuse users' purchases by combining any single transaction with those of other users so that payments cannot be linked to any particular individual.Â  The popularity of Darkcoin is increasing rapidly, and its value has spiralled up from seventy-five cents a coin to almost $7 shortly after its introduction. Another tool, Darkwallet, created by an organisation referring to itself as unSYSTEM, is known to enable 'hyper-anonymised' transactions.Â  Finally, like the bitcoins in the financial world, humans don't need intermediaries to establish a spiritual connection with inner divine selves. We all can find our way through.Â  Further, taking the analogy of Metcalfe's law, if 1000 persons using bitcoins grow to 100000 and if they convert to ten billion. That will decentralise banking systems entirely in the world and bring transparency. Quite similarly, if 1,000 people practising meditation were to increase exponentially to 10 billion people, it would create a new world re-wiring the consciousness of the world as a whole.Â  ...",deccanchronicle.com,4981,news,IN,en,Jayanth  Murali,https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-gpoum7gpnhnbvc0q60br98jhk6-20190128010506.Medi.jpeg,False,@deccanchronicle,12.535249,979b044dadf86c539686407e6835e3a6

One of the network effects necessary for Bitcoin & other crypto assets to become widely adoptedâincluding by institutional investorsâis financialization, as noted by early Bitcoin owner Trace Mayer. I agree with his assessment and believe all crypto assets need financialization in order to succeed, because financializationâif done properlyâenables the efficient allocation of resources. But there's a big problem. Financialization requires the development of markets for lending, and the Bitcoin protocol was not designed to allow bitcoin lending transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. At present, bitcoin lending cannot be done in a trustless manner. The same is true for many crypto assets, but I'll focus on bitcoin in this post because financialization of bitcoin is most advanced relative to other crypto assets.
Development of lending markets is necessary and beneficial, if done right. Despite the lack of trustless lending for bitcoin at present, I'll lay out how financialization of bitcoin can be done responsibly. Building the infrastructure for responsible financialization of bitcoin is a prerequisite to attracting major fiduciary institutional investors, all of whom are held to very high fiduciary standards. Based on my past experience as a fiduciary of pensions, 401(k) plans and a university endowment, the crypto industry needs to up its game before it can become an asset class investable by the big leagues.Â Thankfully, some key achievements are likely to happen in 2019. First Principles: Is Bitcoin Lending Good or Bad?
'Financialization' means the development of markets through which entrepreneurs can borrow money to finance investment in business enterprises. Notice the word borrow. Yes, financialization involves borrowing money. To understand whether debt is good or bad, let's start with first principles.

Money is a good that provides a basic service: a ledger. When you produce something of value and sell it for value, you earn one of the spots on that ledger by receiving money. You want that ledger to have a finite number of spotsâin other words, you want that ledger to be honest. History has repeatedly proven that, over time, the most honest ledger will become the most commonly used ledger, which we call money.
Money can be exchanged for goods and services that are consumed (medium of exchange), or it can be saved (store of value)âboth of these are uses of money, but neither is inherent to money itself. Money is simply a good that serves as a ledgerâa way to keep score. By definition, goods that aren't immediately consumed are saved. Saving, which means foregoing the consumption of goods that were previously produced, makes those resources available for investing ('capital goods'). People invest capital goods in order to produce even more goods or services in the future. If we don't invest those capital goods directly ourselves (e.g., a farmer planting seed corn), we can lend them to someone else who will. The price of borrowing these resourcesâthe interest rateâcoordinates the optimal investment of these saved resources across people, places and time.
Borrowing money facilitates the optimal investment of society's saved resources. Markets for borrowing money enable the calculation of implied interest rates for different time periods (the 'spot' yield curve). And from that yield curve, parties can calculate an implied forward curve for interest rates beginning on future dates instead of today. And from that forward curve, parties can calculate the price of trade credit and financial hedges. Such financial products are necessary for commerce to happen in the real world. All this is good for society, if done right.
Yet, a pre-requisite to achieving these benefits is that money must first be borrowable. If it's not borrowable, financialization cannot occur.
So, for bitcoin & other crypto assets to become financialized, they must be borrowable.
History has proven that markets for borrowing money can become unanchored from the money itself and end up corrupting the moneyâfirst by creating substitutes for the real money, which are accepted as if they're real, and then later by creating insidious mechanisms to inflate the quantity of those money substitutes so that some players gain something for nothing. I call this 'bad financialization.' The temptation to corrupt money through bad financialization is strongâespecially if the process is insidious and difficult to police.
Hence, owners of money must take great care to protect money against the tremendous incentive that exists to corrupt it by creating more claims to money than the quantity of money that exists.
Hence, owners of bitcoin must take great care to protect bitcoin against the tremendous incentive that exists to corrupt it by creating more claims to bitcoin than the quantity of bitcoin that exists.
 Financialization is, therefore, a dicey process. But it is absolutely necessary. Without it, society cannot optimize the investment of saved resources across people, places and time. Consequently, for Bitcoin, responsible financialization will involve finding ways to lend bitcoin without corrupting it by creating more claims to bitcoin than there are bitcoins.
Here's a basic technological framework for distinguishing the good from the bad types of bitcoin financialization:
 all bitcoin lending/financial products that transact on the Bitcoin blockchain will, by definition, be the good type of financialization. all bitcoin lending/financial products that do NOT transact on the Bitcoin blockchain should be presumed to be the bad type of financializationâalbeit rebuttable if the issuers of such products prove they are 100% collateralized at all times and that they never artificially inflate bitcoin's supply, even momentarily. 
Category 1 doesn't exist yet, unfortunately. Currently there's no trustless way to settle the fiat-currency leg of a bitcoin loan, which must settle in traditional banking infrastructure (off the Bitcoin blockchain).
Category 2 includes all custodial crypto exchanges, coin lending businesses, crypto custodians, and issuers of Wall Street products that 'physically' settle in bitcoin (futures, ETFs, depositary receipts, etc). These businesses actually settle most of their transaction volume off the Bitcoin blockchain. It may be possible for them to provide cryptographic proof of reserves, but that's exceedingly rare. The issuers of financial products that settle transactions using traditional Wall Street infrastructure will find it nearly impossible to prove that they're 100% collateralized all the timeâif they even wanted to prove itâsimply because Wall Street's ledgers are never 100% in sync, and its infrastructure inherently creates more claims to assets than there are underlying assets (see here, here, here and here for more explanation).
To summarize thus far, please ponder this: Is debt inherently bad? No, not always. The lending of saved resources is fundamentally good because it enables the optimal investment of those saved resources.
Some types of debt are, however, quite bad. Any form of debt that creates multiple claims to the very same asset is quite bad. Why? Because these forms of debt create more claims to an asset than there are assets, thereby suppressing the asset's price. Why? All else equal, increasing the supply of something drives its price down. That's simple supply/demand dynamics.
So, applying these first-principles to bitcoin, we can draw two conclusions:
 Bitcoin lending is fundamentally goodâbut only if the same bitcoin is lent exactly once. If the same bitcoin is lent and then re-lent (rehypothecated), that's bad because it creates more claims to bitcoin than there are bitcoins. Markets that enable the shorting of bitcoin are also fundamentally goodâbut only if the short seller actually borrows bitcoin before selling it short. If the short seller shorts bitcoin before borrowing it, that's bad because it creates more claims to bitcoin than there are bitcoins. 
In the absence of protocol-level mechanisms supporting peer-to-peer coin lending, how can bitcoin lending markets develop responsibly? The only option is to establish legal structures that clearly define and protect property rights. Even the purists would likely appreciate this, since property rights stem from natural law.
Until Trustless Bitcoin Lending Comes Along, Here's How to Prevent Bad Financialization
Property rights in the U.S. are protected by state law, not federal law, and state law also governs the creation of liens on assets pledged as collateral for loans.
But there's a big problem. No state has yet clarified the precise legal status of crypto assets or clearly defined the process for a lender to place a legally-enforceable lien on a lent crypto asset. Coin lending and coin custody businesses already exist, of course, but every U.S. party involved in coin lending and coin custody is taking some degree of legal risk because the law is simply not clear. In the absence of clear law, it's not predictable how judges will rule in litigation or bankruptcy.
The fiduciaries of what I call 'fiduciary institutional investors'âmutual funds, pension funds, 401(k) plans, endowments, foundations and insurance companiesâsimply cannot take such open-ended legal risk (in the way that a hedge fund or venture capital fund can, since hedge funds & VC funds are expected to have higher risk/reward relative to 'fiduciary institutional investors'). Speaking as a former fiduciary of multiple pensions, 401(k)s and an endowment, legal clarity is an absolute prerequisite.
 Wyoming is endeavoring to solve this problemâand solve it in a way that preserves the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain protocols. DisclosureâWyoming is my native state, and I've been volunteering over the past year to advance this and other legislation that attracts the blockchain industry to Wyoming by providing an enabling legal framework.
Forbes has already written a story about Wyoming's proposed bill to solve these problems, SF 125,Â and here are the key points. If the bill becomes law, it would:
 For everyone: Provide basic legal clarity for crypto assets ('digital assets'). This isn't rocket science, and I'm amazed no US state has done this yet. Such clarity would enable coin lending markets in the US to develop free of the legal uncertainty hanging over them today. Consequently, financialization can begin to flourish. For everyone: Cleanse digital assets of stale liens after two years, as long as the coins are stored in a Wyoming custodian. This solves a problem many legal scholars have identified for the sector, which is that stale liens can pop up years laterâa nasty surprise for coin owners who might otherwise discover they never legally owned their coins. For digital asset custodians: Create a superior regulatory path for digital asset custodians to achieve the big prize, which is 'qualified custodian' status pursuant to the SEC's custody rule. Since 1940 that rule has required US investment companies (such as mutual fund managers) and large US investment advisers to store the assets they manage at an unaffiliated custodian. Until the SEC clarifies that a blockchain itself can be a custodian (which it should), investment managers will need to engage digital asset custodians. Many firms are currently building institutional-quality custody platforms, but all of them currently suffer from the lack of an ideal regulatory pathâthey're pursuing a state-by-state licensing strategy. Well, Wyoming's bill would solve that. Banks can do business in all 50 states and have other advantages as well. For investors: Provide an opt-in regime for enhanced supervision, which means Wyoming's digital asset custodians can choose to opt-into a higher standard that would provide some very basic investor protections that don't really exist in the industry (including custody as bailment rather than as an IOU). Other investor protections include the 3 D'sâdefine, disclose, delegate. Custodians must define which version of source code they're running ('bitcoin is a digital asset' won't cut it as a contractual definition for big institutional investors). All gains from client assets belong to the client, unless expressly disclosedÂ otherwise and the client agreed. Customers must delegate authority to custodians before custodians can take action on anything. Most exchanges/custodians today aren't set up to comply with the 3 D's but will need to be ready to before providing services to the 'fiduciary investment manager' market segment. For Wyoming: bring JOBS and REVENUE to the State. For everyone: Enable the peer-to-peer nature of the technology. As one example, the bill enables a smart contract to take custody of a digital assetâsmoothing the legal path to responsible financialization of Ethereum andâas soon as trustless lending becomes possibleâBitcoin too. 
I'll close with my favorite reaction to the Wyoming news, posted by Donald McIntyre on Twitter. If SF 125 and the other proposed billsâincluding a special-purpose financial institution, a fintech sandbox, Wyoming's Secretary of State integrating with a blockchain, recognition of tokenized securities and a chancery court to litigate business disputesâall become law, I believe the answer to Donald's question will become obvious. Stay tunedâthe news should be out by late February!

By CCN.com: In the last 24 hours, seemingly unaffected by the withdrawal of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and VanEck Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Bitcoin price has remained stable at $3,500.

Based on the relatively strong performance of major crypto assets, it is likely that many investors generally considered the probability of a Bitcoin ETF approval in the first quarter of 2019 to be low.

Halvening May Lead Bitcoin to Recovery

According to a cryptocurrency technical analyst and trader with an online alias 'Moon Overlord,' the anticipated halvening of the Bitcoin network's block rewards in May 2020 could lead to the recovery of the dominant cryptocurrency.

Anonymous Bitcoin miners are taking over the network,David Canellis,2019-01-15 16:46:53,full,https://thenextweb.com/news/unknown-bitcoin-miners-cryptocurrency,thenextweb.com,"""Unknown,"" anonymous Bitcoin miners are now validating more blocks than anyone else on the network, as Bitmain's influence dwindles.","The world's most popular cryptocurrency is a now a little bit more decentralized, thanks to the waning influence of Bitmain and the return of the anonymous Bitcoin miner.
Blockchain research unit Diar has published new data revealing exactly who has been validatingÂ the Bitcoin network.
Analysts determined that mining pools either owned by or heavily tied to Bitmain (Antpool, BTC.com, and ViaBTC) are now validating far less Bitcoin blocks than this time last year.
In fact, it is 'unknown' anonymous Bitcoin miners who are currently validating more blocks than any individual pool.

'[Unknown] miners closed December having solved a whopping 22 [percent] of the total blocks, up from 6 [percent] at the start of last year,' reported Diar. 'The Bitcoin network is currently less likely to experience an attack given the fact the BTC.com controlled pools have lost dominance over the network.'
At pixel time, 'unknown' miners accounted for more than 23 percent of the computing power driving the Bitcoin network (hash power).
Source: blockchain.com
Does this actually make Bitcoin âsafer'?
Bitmain is the world's leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining equipment, and has historically been a powerhouse of the Bitcoin network.
Diar reports that in early 2018, Bitmain's mining pools accounted for 53 percent of Bitcoin's hash power. Theoretically, this would have allowed them to collude to take control of Bitcoin with a '51-percent attack.'
Indeed, a reduction in their influence is surely a big relief for those wary of 51-percent attacksÂ on Bitcoin, like the one suffered by Ethereum Classic that effectively led to $1.1 million being stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.
For this to happen, major players such as Antpool and BTC.com would need to team up to control a majority of the network's hash power. This would allow them approve, censor, or even rollback transactions as they please.
Diar conceded that while the threat of that happening may now be much lower, miners have no obligation to share details related to the pools to which they may be contributing.
This means that some (or all) of the 'unknown' miners could really be working with one of the larger mining pools.
â¦ but the miners could be waiting for Bitcoin to bounce
The analysts also noted that miners who have turned off their equipment are likely waiting for an uptrend in Bitcoinâs price before they resume validating transactions.
Last month, when Bitcoinâs price briefly jumped from $3,200 to over $4,000, the overall Bitcoin hash power increased for the first time since August.

This indicates a distinct correlation between Bitcoinâs price and the number of miners who are prepared to participate in the network.
Diar did warn that January's growth in hash rate is unlikely to be sustainable, especially if the price returns to its now-typical bearish ways. This means ifÂ Bitcoinâs price bounces, mining pools controlled by Bitmain could come back online.
At least for now, let's enjoy the new Bitcoin with more decentralization (and less Bitmain).",thenextweb.com,702,news,US,en,"David Canellis,Story By",https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F11%2Fasus-cryptocurrency-mining-gamers-graphic-card-bitcoin.jpg&signature=7b8bb39a9f58d891661d5ad48a187167,False,@thenextweb,12.516063,343a923cc9fa932c5d2a03a2269ce49c

There have been a few changes since the report was first created, such as the switch from using the Bitcoin (BTC-USD)(OTCQX:GBTC)(COIN) market cap to the price. If you would like to dig deeper into the statistical relationships between the network data and the Bitcoin price, check out this article, where my unconventional approach is validated using Spearman's Rho. Signal Breakdown This time I want to start with the result and then work backwards. See below. Indicator Name Unique Addresses Hash Power Total Transactions Predicted Price $1,543 $5,153 $4,076 Actual / Predicted 2.41x 0.72x 0.91x Metric Signal Overbought Oversold Oversold Source: Bitcoin Value Indicator tables and blockchain.com Source: blockchain.com and author's new charts January 2019 Signal If the Bitcoin price is below all three prediction metrics, then we have a situation that historically results in strong price performance of the coming months or even years. When the price is above all three prediction metrics, that has historically been a sign that the price could be nearing a correction phase. The rest of the time, the price is below at least one prediction metric and above at least one other. In that state, the near-term movements are less clear. This is the position we are in right now, which I call ""it's complicated."" Let's talk about Unique Addresses The number of unique addresses in use were greatly reduced after the last bubble due to a couple of factors. (1) There were a great many speculators who simply quit using or trading Bitcoin after the last bubble burst. They had many bitcoin addresses, but then they sold or consolidated all their funds into a single address for long-term storage. (2) In the peak of the last bubble, the Bitcoin network became nearly unusable due to high fees. However, with the increased adoption of SegWit, the average fees fell and people used this opportunity to consolidate the ""dust"" in their wallets, which is basically the equivalent of trading in one hundred pennies for a single $1 bill (or four quarters, you get the idea). However, performance is a moving target and Bitcoin will need many more upgrades before it's ready to compete with global financial institutions. Let's look at some of this technology now. Scaling Technology Bitcoin juggernaut Blockstream has launched their own solution aimed at moving transactions off the base layer and onto a federated sidechain. This approach has been criticized by some because of the open nature of Bitcoin. But I take a different point of view when it comes to this approach, which they call Liquid Sidechain. My reasoning is this. You can build permission-based systems on top of an open and permissionless system, but the opposite is not true. If I want to open a ""Bitcoin Bank"" where we deal in fiat and Bitcoin, I can take possession of your Bitcoin for a fee, offer you insurance, and you can have a system very similar to the one we have now. You might be thinking, ""what's the point of that?"" The point is that the market will deliver to the people whatever they're willing to pay for. If you want Bitcoin insurance, someone will offer it. If you want to store your Bitcoin at Wells Fargo, then I bet you'll be able to at some point. In this scenario, the bank's behavior is similar to what happens on exchanges right now. I can move credits from one account to another without ever hitting the blockchain. This lessens the burden on the blockchain, at the price of trusting the institution. Where this might make sense is for large institutions that do actually trust each other. If I don't trust you, or I don't know you, then I would default to a higher level of security and require a transaction on the base layer. I don't want to get off on a tangent here, but I think we should open our minds to a world in which mixed security is the norm. In fact, some aspects of this system already exist. For example, if I have a Visa card, most vendors will trust an authorization when I swipe my card. But, if I'm buying a house, you probably want me to write you a check. And if you're the bank of international settlements, you would even move large quantities of gold between countries at great expense every few years. Varying security for varying levels of trust. Source: liquid.horse These humble statistics show that while the liquid sidechain is tiny right now, there's significant growth. Bear in mind that this sidechain has only been around for three months. Bakkt Bakkt, from the Intercontinental Exchange, announced that they raised $182M in their first round of funding. The reason this matters for scaling technology is that Bakkt is launching a Bitcoin futures contract with physical delivery, complete with a Lightning Network style layer two solution. This means that Bakkt's growth will be more sustainable as only settling transactions will need to be transmitted on chain. 'Our system would operate on a layer above the blockchain, and we'd keep our own omnibus ledger apart from the blockchain,' explains Loeffler. The Bakkt design isn't revolutionary. It closely resembles a technology called 'the lightning network' that's already in use. In the lightning network, the same two participants, say an appliance maker and a parts supplier, engage in multiple Bitcoin transactions. As long as the parties are using a fixed number of Bitcoins to buy, sell from one another, and store for that purpose, the transactions aren't reported to the blockchain, and zap back and forth within the same ecosystem. - Fortune The reason this is a big deal for scaling is that since their launch, Bitcoin futures have grown month-over-month by nearly 25%, according to LedgerX. These futures are settled in cash, but they give us an idea of what might happen with Bakkt's Bitcoin settled contracts. If Bitcoin settled futures were to see that same growth, then it could cause network congestion issues if a scaling platform was not in place. In other words, when Bakkt goes live, we might see a smaller than anticipated impact to the number of unique addresses in use because of transactions that will occur on the omnibus layer. The Lightning Network The Lightning Network had an incredible year. While the network itself is still small when compared to the Bitcoin base layer - there are now more than 20k channels between peers and over 520 Bitcoin on all channels. Source: p2sh.info Transactions on any of these second layer solutions will have minimal impact on the number of unique addresses in use (a one-to-many relationship). Starting with a single Bitcoin on the Lightning Network back in January of 2018, the channel capacity doubled nine times by the end of December. If this pace continues, we will see 1% of the circulating bitcoin on the Lightning Network before the end of 2019. Therefore, while the sum of all the activity of these systems is still minimal, it's clear that at the current pace of expansion it won't be long until a tipping point is reached. The tipping point will signify a point in time where the transaction throughput of the network is no longer a constraint. This will unlock massive upside potential in the price. Base layer enhancements While layer two solutions and sidechains are taking off, the base layer is not being neglected. Solutions like Segwit are now more common, and hot on its heels are Schnorr Signatures and Bulletproofs. The combination of these technologies will increase the base layer throughput of Bitcoin by orders of magnitude over the next few years. I believe that by 2020 the implications of these changes will be hard to understate. By the time that the next block reward halving occurs, the Bitcoin network will be able to process more transactions more securely than ever before. With added layers of security and privacy being baked in, Bitcoin will be poised to disrupt global economics like never before. Let's talk about hash rate The hash rate of the Bitcoin network has gone through periods of decline in the past. Looking at this data on a monthly scale I can see only one other time where a three month decrease was registered. Source: blockchain.com and author's new charts Zooming out puts the hash power in perspective. Even with the recent decline in hash power, it still doubled in 2018 (up 19x from two years ago) while the price went from near $20k to the $3k range. Mining profits have been squeezed, but the miners with the lowest cost structure will persist unless that system itself collapses, because of downward adjustments in the difficulty. Source: blockchain.com Conclusion The number of unique addresses gives the most conservative price prediction for Bitcoin as of Jan. 1, 2019. However, as more activity moves off chain, this is to be expected. The price of Bitcoin is now below the predictions of the hash rate and the total number of transactions. The signal for January is ""it's complicated,"" but I get the feeling that we're very close to a change in the season.

'I like bitcoin because it's not correlated with [the stock market],' Miller told CNBC (video below). 'It does have the potential to be worth a lot, and the potential to be worth zero.'

Invested $1 Billion in Bitcoin in 2017

Miller claims he's a bitcoin observer, not a bull. But he has an interesting history with the flagship virtual currency. In December 2017, Miller made headlines in when he invested $1 billion of his firm's assets in BTC at the height of the market.

Miller also invested 1% of his personal net worth (which is undisclosed) in bitcoin, as CCN reported. He has apparently scaled back his firm's allocation to BTC in the wake of the prolonged bear market.

However, he calls the original cryptocurrency an 'interesting technological experiment' that investors should not cavalierly dismiss.

Miller: BTC Has No Correlation To Stock Market

Bill Miller said the one thing he likes about bitcoin is that its performance is uncorrelated to the broader stock market. This makes them a good investment during down markets, he said.

'Bitcoin basically has no statistical correlation with stocks or bonds, which makes it an excellent diversifier,' Miller reasoned.

Bitcoin peaked in December of last year. And the stock market peaked in January [2018]. It went down for four or five weeks, and then rallied through September 2018. All that time, bitcoin was going down, so the correlation there was negative.

âVery Clear Pattern' of Higher Lows

While some analysts agree that there's some correlation between crypto and tech stocks, many say there's a far smaller relationship between crypto and the general stock market.

Miller says if anything, bitcoin trends have preceded the stock market. He pointed out that the stock market weakened right after the bitcoin price started to drop.

Story continues

Bitcoin peaked in December of last year, and the stock market peaked in January [2018]. It went down for four or five weeks, and then rallied through September 2018. All this time, bitcoin was going down, so the correlation there was negative. In the very short term, bitcoin tended to lead the [stock] market. Bitcoin bottomed 52 weeks after it peaked in December [2017]. And it started up again. The stock market didn't bottom for another three to four weeks. Now the stock market is starting up. Who knows if that correlation will hold?

Despite the current Crypto Winter, Miller noted that there's a 'very clear pattern' of higher lows amid the constant price fluctuations.

'Take a look at the low for bitcoin each year since it came out 10 years ago,' Miller said. 'By and large, there's a very clear pattern of higher lows.'

On January 7, CCN reported that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan is considering the approval of the country's first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

With the final deadline of the VanEck Bitcoin ETF on the horizon, could the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in Japan have an impact on the decision of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?

Probability of a Bitcoin ETF in US

The probability of the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by February remains low. A pro-crypto SEC commissioner Hester Peirce previously said that investors should not wait on a Bitcoin ETF because it may take days or years for the commission to approve it.

Whether the ETF gets approved or not, the filing of a VanEck ETF will provide more clarity on the subject.

In the second half of 2018, the SEC rejected 12 Bitcoin ETFs submitted by the Winklevoss twins and three other companies. The Winklevoss twins attempted to launch an ETF using cryptocurrency exchanges to calculate the base price of the asset and the three companies relied on the Bitcoin futures market to develop an ETF.

All 11 filings were rejected by the SEC because it believed that both exchanges and the futures market are not of significant size.

The VanEck ETF uses data from the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which is said to be bigger than the cryptocurrency exchange market in terms of volume and trading activity.

Regardless of the result, it will lead the SEC to evaluate the global cryptocurrency OTC market and also consider the tightening regulatory frameworks in major overseas markets.

Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malta, and other regions have implemented strict policies on Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), monitoring suspicious transactions and disallowing anonymous accounts from trading cryptocurrencies.

In late November of last year, SEC chairman Jay Clayton said that safeguards and technologies to prevent suspicious transactions are non-existent in overseas markets.

Clayton said:

Those kinds of safeguards don't exist in many of the markets where digital currencies trade.

With the lead of Japan and the G20's move to regulate cryptocurrencies, many major Bitcoin and crypto asset markets have implemented various safeguards. Some regions like South Korea have implemented stricter rules than the U.S., specifically on the prohibition of foreigners and unidentified individuals from trading cryptocurrencies with the Korean won.

Could Japan Sway the SEC?

If a Bitcoin ETF is approved in Japan before the U.S., there exists a possibility that it may lead the U.S. government to approve a Bitcoin ETF in its local market.

Japan remains as the only country to have integrated a national licensing program for cryptocurrency exchanges, only allowing a handful of exchanges that are fully compliant with existing regulations to operate within the country.

Currently, the time frame of the FSA's decision on the approval of Bitcoin ETFs is uncertain and it may also take many months for the government to come to a consensus on the subject.

By CCN.com: In the last 48 hours, despite the withdrawal of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and VanEck Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Bitcoin price has increased from $3,511 to $3,657 by nearly two percent.

Although the lack of a major price movement following a highly anticipated event like the VanEck ETF withdrawal demonstrated a low level of trading activity in the global crypto market, traders expect the volatility in Bitcoin markets to increase in the upcoming weeks.

Will More Volatility be Beneficial to Bitcoin?

Since January 11, for more than two weeks, the Bitcoin price has remained stable in a low and tight price range between $3,500 to $4,000, unable to break out of key resistance levels nor fall below crucial support levels.

Analysts expected a decline in the Bitcoin price following the withdrawal given that the CBOE/VanEck Bitcoin ETF was arguably the most highly anticipated proposal to date.

No Visible Impact on the Bitcoin Price

On CNBC's ETF Edge, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck stated that the shutdown of the U.S. government forced the institution to pull out its proposal. The lack of personnel at the commission prevented the continuation of discussions on various aspects of the Bitcoin ETF filing.

'We were engaged in discussions with the SEC about the bitcoin-related issues, custody, market manipulation, prices, and that had to stop. And so, instead of trying to slip through or something, we just had the application pulled and we will re-file when the SEC gets going again,' van Eck said.

More âcrypto is dead.' Only then do we move higher,' he tweeted. Market analyst Jani Ziedins also has reservations about the future of the nascent technology. 'There are cases like the dot-com bubble where the revolution was legitimate, the investors just got excited a little too early. Will bitcoin do the same in 10 years? I have my doubts,' he said in an email to MarketWatch. 'First, the magical thing about bitcoin was that by design it has a fixed supply. That was supposed to prevent manipulation and inflation.

Bitcoin is 10 years old. But it won't go mainstream until it's regulated,Paul R. La Monica,2019-01-14 19:20:15,full,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/14/investing/bitcoin-prices/index.html,cnn.com,"Bitcoin just celebrated its tenth anniversary. Now, as the world's most famous cryptocurrency matures, its future is far from certain.","Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency, just celebrated its tenth anniversary. 
 

 The digital currency has made plenty of strides toward legitimacy since it first launched, but it won't become a mainstream investment without the embrace of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 

 The SEC has yet to give the green light to any bitcoin projects. The agency has already rejected bitcoin ETF plans from Direxion, ProShares and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who became known for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of the idea for Facebook. 
 

 Bitwise Asset Management filed last week with the SEC for an exchange-traded fund that would track bitcoin's performance. Another company, Wilshire Phoenix Funds, filed to sell shares of a fund that would own a mix of bitcoin, short-term Treasury bills and US dollars. 
 

 A decision about another proposed bitcoin ETF from mutual fund firm VanEck has been delayed. Because the shutdown is forcing the SEC to run with limited staff, that issue is not likely to be resolved until the government reopens. 
 










Bitcoin prices keeps plunging. When will they hit bottom?




 The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.
 

 Matt Hougan, global head of research for Bitwise Asset Management, said he thinks the SEC is just being prudent and won't rush to give the thumbs up to ETFs for an asset class that's still evolving. 
 

 He noted the SEC took a similarly cautious approach to gold ETFs several years ago before approving many of them. The Winklevoss twins said in an interview this week that they agree with the SEC's cautious approach and will wait years for it to approve their ETF. 
 

 Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin present a lot of reason for caution. 
 

 Although the price of a single bitcoin (XBT) was once worth nearly $20,000 in December 2017, the value has fallen more than 80% since then to about $3,650. The currency is often compared unfavorably to the greatest financial panics in history. 
 

 'Bitcoin is a speculative asset that's still in its infancy,' said John Ryding, an economist and adviser at Moeda, which uses blockchain technology to help small businesses get loans. 'It can take quite a while for the market to shake out some of the excess. The good news is that bitcoin's been beaten up but it's still in the game.'
 

 Bitcoin optimists like Hougan think the worst is over. And there's evidence of mainstream acceptance. 
 

 In 2017, bitcoin futures launched on both the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the mutual fund giant Fidelity also established a trading platform for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies late last year. 
 

 Noted bitcoin bear Jeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital sounds positive, too. He recently told investors he thinks bitcoin prices could rally later this year and get back to about $5,000. That's nowhere near the currency's high, but it still is about a 35% gain from current levels. Stable trading could help convince the SEC that the time is right to change its tune. 
 

 Others aren't so sure that bitcoin's on the rebound. 
 

 'We have not seen the bottom in bitcoin,' wrote Marin Katusa, head of Katusa Research in a recent report. 'The dot-com bubble of the late '90s played out exactly the same way. Hundreds of companies rode the soaring wave of investor sentiment in order to cash in on the hysteria. Hysteria can only support valuations for so long, and eventually fundamentals take over.'
 

 Hysteria often gives way to fear as well. The dramatic drop might have scared off some investors forever. 
 

 Hougan conceded that there needs to be a big shakeout in the cryptocurrency market for bitcoin to rebound. There are simply too many digital coins out there, and bitcoin still has the dominant market share. 
 

 'Most cryptocurrencies are garbage and will be discarded into the dustbin of history,' Hougan said. 'The sooner the better.'",cnn.com,61,news,US,en,"CNN Business,Paul R.

The SEC is considering an application for an institutionally-focused bitcoin ETF from VanEck and fintech firm SolidX, but a decision on that fund was previously delayed and could be delayed further due to the government shutdown.With hundreds of new ETFs coming to market every year, it may seem like it's easy to bring these products to market, but Bitwise reminds industry observers that concepts that look easy to launch today once faced hurdles similar to what bitcoin ETFs currently face.It took six years from the first filings for actively managed and leveraged ETFs to see those products come to life and there was a nine-year gap in between the launch of the first equity-based ETF and the first fixed income ETF, according to Bitwise.What's NextBitwise draws some comparisons between the state of bitcoin ETF efforts today and the situation faced by the SPDR Gold Shares GLD prior to its late 2004 launch.'Prior to the launch of GLD, there were plenty of ways for investors to buy gold,' said Bitwise. 'They could buy it directly from dealers, they could buy futures, or they could buy gold mining stocks. In many ways, it was exactly equivalent to today's situation with bitcoin, where investors can buy directly on exchanges, can buy futures or can invest indirectly via blockchain equity ETFs.'There are no guarantees a bitcoin ETF, if approved, will find the immediate success that GLD did, but a bitcoin ETF would make the digital currency more accessible and potentially more palatable to a broader swath of investors.Related Links:A Healthy Healthcare ETFBig Growth For This Dividend ETF",benzinga.com,1933,news,US,en,"Benzinga Staff Writer,ETF Professor",https://www.benzinga.com/next-assets/images/safari-pinned-tab.svg,False,@benzinga,12.498799,dbbba820b2bcbbc2d6543f178385cfdd

On January 2, the dominant cryptocurrency eyed a breakout above the $4,000 resistance level, but it struggled to increase further from $3,912, retracing to $3,780.

Boring Year For Bitcoin in 2019

Historically, Bitcoin has tended to take 62 weeks on average to recover from a major correction or a bear market, and all five corrections the asset experienced in the past nine years were in the 85 to 90 percent range in terms of loss from an all-time high.

Bitcoin achieved an all-time high at $19,665 on December 16 and since then, the price of the asset has continued to experience a steep decline against the U.S. dollar. In December 2018, Bitcoin fell to $3,210, recording an 83 percent drop from its all-time high.

The historical performance of Bitcoin does not provide clarity on the future performance of the cryptocurrency. However, it can be used as a reference to forecast the time frame of the asset's recovery.

Willy Woo, a cryptocurrency analyst and the creator of Woobull.com, stated in November that the fundamental indicators of Bitcoin show a potential rebound of the asset in the second quarter of 2019.

'Putting together the blockchain view, I suspect the timing for a bottom may be around Q2 2019. After that we start the true accumulation band, only after that, do we start a long grind upwards,' Woo said at the time when the price of Bitcoin was $7,000.

Considering that Bitcoin needed just over 15 months in the past four corrections to recover, if the asset recovers by the second quarter of this year, it would be similar to the recovery of previous corrections.

According to a cryptocurrency trader known as 'The Crypto Dog,' the Bitcoin price may show stability and a low level of volatility throughout this year, presenting a boring year for traders.

The trader said:

BTC has mostly bottomed (might even have put the final low in) but we're not going to see a significant rally or new highs for awhile so that's not much to get excited about. Cheers to a boring 2019.

Has Bitcoin Bottomed?

Bitcoin price

Most analysts are in agreement that Bitcoin is close to achieving its bottom. Some predict that $3,210 may have been the lowest point for the asset but some traders have argued that there currently exists no solid indicators to prove that the asset conclusively established a proper bottom.

It is challenging to declare the bottom of the asset because of its wild volatility in a low price range. While crypto assets in the likes of Ethereum and Ripple (XRP) have made large gains over the past month, with Ethereum recovering by 80 percent, the market is still showing some weaknesses.

As seen in the $5 billion decline of cryptocurrencies on the day, until the market goes through a several-month-long consolidation period, investors would have to expect high volatility.

Bitcoin 2019 Forecast: A Make Or Break Situation,Sandeep Singh Ahluwalia,2019-01-15 12:53:52,full,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4233406-bitcoin-2019-forecast-make-break-situation,seekingalpha.com,"In 2018, Bitcoin's price fell by roughly 81.24%. Production costs of mining Bitcoin are rising.","In my 2018 articles on Bitcoin (OTCQX:GBTC) I was largely negative on the cryptocurrency (COIN) as I was saw the expectations of crypto investors were pegged on hope rather than hard facts. I say this as in 2018 analysts were harping on the fact that Bitcoin was the immediate solution to a lot of problems in the future. However, I believe this to be false as the asset class can only grow if it receives recognition from the regulatory authorities it was initially meant to circumvent. However, I have no doubt that the underlying technology of blockchain is amazing and has the potential of revolutionising our everyday lives. Nevertheless, this is irrelevant to investors as they would only like to know whether the cryptocurrency's price will be rising or not in 2019. Thus, to answer this I shall look at the fundamental news affecting Bitcoin, whilst, also analysing the chart using technical analysis tools. This is as I believe the cryptocurrency is at a crossroad where it is simply a make or break situation for it. Fundamental news: SEC Delays Decision on VanEck-SolidX Bitcoin ETF: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission extended the review period for VanEck's Bitcoin ETF to 27th February 2019. This serves Bitcoin aficionados with a huge blow as the VanEck proposal differs from other cryptocurrency applications. I say this as the VanEck ETF is fully reliant on Bitcoin itself, unlike the other applications in which the ETF's are reliant on the futures market. Thus, I believe this delay will cause the price of Bitcoin to fall further as this is one of the biggest hopes crypto traders have. This is as an ETF approval is expected to trigger a price rally. Thus, the reason I say 2019 is a make or break situation for the cryptocurrency is because the SEC is not allowed to further extend the review period from 27th February 2019. Hence, the decision will finally arrive and if the ETF is rejected then this would prove detrimental to the value of the cryptocurrency and the asset class. Rising production costs: As covered in a prior article Bitcoin's price is currently right above its Cross of Death point. However, I believe Bitcoin may have to up its price game in 2019 to stay above it's Cross of Death point. I say this as the production cost of Bitcoin mining is rising. This is as according to a recent study the price of Bitcoin needs to be around the $6,500 to $7,000 range for it to be profitable to mine in 2019. Hence, due to this I expect a lot of digital currency-focused business to shrink their mining capacities or close altogether. This is as last week reports surfaced that Bitmain, which designs ASIIC chips for Bitcoin mining, has been hit by huge losses due to the price of Bitcoin collapsing. Moreover, the company is expected to lay off a sizable portion of its employees. Thus, the big question Bitcoin investors ought to ask themselves in 2019 is till what extent will the increase in cost of mining affect the asset class. Positive developments: Not all is dull and gloomy in the cryptocurrency market. I say this as even though cryptocurrency prices are trending downwards, there are some crypto admirers who are not giving up on the asset class. Thus, due to this there are still numerous positive developments occurring that are helping build necessary infrastructure for the crypto market which can allow this asset class to thrive in the future. This is a positive development as we traders have to understand that Bitcoin and its peers are still in their relatively nascent stages. Thus, if individuals can solve the limitations of the asset class, then there is a possibility of the crypto market once again coming to life. However, most of these efforts won't have an impact on the cryptocurrency market until 2020 as they shall take time to develop. Technical Analysis: Price History: To say Bitcoin has had a rough 2018 would be one hell of an understatement. I say this as the cryptocurrency closed the year 2017 on a highly positive note. This is as the cryptocurrency ended December 2017 on a high of $19,891. However, January 2018 turned out to be a painful start as Bitcoin formed a Bear Sash candle pattern. This in turn triggered a fall that continued till December 2018 which resulted in Bitcoin losing roughly 81.24% of its value. Daily chart: The cryptocurrency's daily chart indicates to investors that in the coming weeks, Bitcoin shall be trading in a box range pattern. I say this as I do not expect any significant move to the upside or to the downside up until the decision from the SEC is delivered on February 27th. Moreover, we see that the cryptocurrency is presently trading below its Ichimoku cloud pattern which clearly shows that no significant upswing can be expected any time soon. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency's daily chart has formed a âDoji' candle pattern after forming a large bearish candle. This candle pattern psychology indicates to investors that the bulls have managed to neutralise the bearish strength. This in turn shall ensure that Bitcoin's uses the current price level as a support for the foreseeable future. On the price target front, I expect the upper line of box range pattern to be between the 61.8% and 78.6% fibonacci resistance levels. The 61.8% fibonacci resistance level is at $4,183, whilst, the 78.6% fibonacci resistance level is at $4,301. On the support front, I expect the lower line of the box range pattern to be between the 61.8% and 78.6% fibonacci support levels. The 61.8% fibonacci support level is at $3,680, whilst, the 78.6% fibonacci support level is at $3,569. However, if the cryptocurrency does breach the 78.6% support level, then I do not expect the fall to go beyond the 100% fibonacci support level at $3,427. The big picture: Overall, I am leaning towards the bulls and bears having a tug of war which will result in Bitcoin trading in a box range pattern. This is driven by the fact that the technicals support a sideways formation in the commodity. However, whichever way you decide to trade, do ensure that you utilize trailing stops, as this shall aid in capital preservation. Good luck trading.",seekingalpha.com,892,news,US,en,Sandeep Singh Ahluwalia,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/1/14/48894499-15474507285653799_origin.jpg,False,@SeekingAlpha,12.494766,7ca436434ad8df017d94d58cb67357c1
How Bitcoin Could Help Iran Undermine U.S. Sanctions (Published 2019),Thomas Erdbrink,2019-01-29 19:18:21,full,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/world/middleeast/bitcoin-iran-sanctions.html,nytimes.com,"The cryptocurrency could allow Iranians to make international payments without using the U.S. banking system, an important lever of American power.","Continue reading the main storyA Bitcoin processing or mining site in the desert outside of Tehran. Cryptocurrency mining is taking off in Iran, where electricity costs are low.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesTEHRAN â Stepping from a car into a muddy industrial site in the Iranian desert, a 22-year-old European Bitcoin investor raised his voice to be heard over the roar of a gas-fired generator.His Iranian counterparts â a bespectacled information-technology specialist, a self-described ââhard-core Bitcoiner'' and the businessman running the site â walked their foreign visitor over to gray shipping containers containing thousands of small computers. When completed and connected to the power grid, the computers would help process a cryptocurrency that, in theory at least, could enable Iran to evade United States sanctions.The value of Bitcoin, the dominant online currency in the world, is treacherously unpredictable. But it is an emerging front in the economic war between Washington and Tehran.Iran's economy has been hobbled by banking sanctions that effectively stop foreign companies from doing business in the country. But transactions in Bitcoin, difficult to trace, could allow Iranians to make international payments while bypassing the American restrictions on banks.In the past, the threat of United States sanctions has been enough to squelch most business with Iran, but the anonymous payments made in Bitcoin could change that. While Washington could still monitor and intimidate major companies, countless small and midsize companies could exploit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to conduct business under American radar.The United States Treasury, well aware of the threat, is attempting to bring Bitcoin and the others into line. In recent weeks, in response to an internet fraud case originating from Iran, the Treasury imposed sanctions on two Iranians and the Bitcoin addresses, or ââwallets,'' they had used for trading in the currency.The Treasury also has warned digital marketplaces that buy and sell Bitcoin and companies that sell computers used to process Bitcoin transactions that they should not provide services to Iranians. Several well-known trading sites are now blocking buyers and sellers from Iran. Some have confiscated money belonging to clients based in Iran.'Treasury will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies,' the department said in a statement.Ziya Sadr, a Bitcoin expert, finances his international business transactions entirely with Bitcoin.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesBut by their nature, cryptocurrencies are uncontrolled by any person or entity. At best, efforts to regulate or monitor trade in them are episodic, whack-a-mole affairs. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there is simply no way to duplicate the banking sanctions that have proved so damaging to the Iranian economy.Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a digital ledger or database known as the blockchain, maintained communally by many independent computers. The system is designed explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Like emails delivered without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records enables the movement of money without going through any central authority.The Iranian government has been slow to recognize the potential sanctions-evading possibilities of Bitcoin. But it is now considering the establishment of exchanges to facilitate trading, one official, Abdolhassan Firouzabadi, said recently. Despite the failure of Venezuela's state-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro, Iran's central bank said recently that it was seriously considering creation of something similar, possibly called the Crypto-Rial, named after the national currency, the rial.Still, Iran's venture into Bitcoin pales in comparison to what has been happening the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where thousands of people have jumped into the cryptocurrency business.At the computerized processing operation in the Iranian desert, no one seemed particularly concerned with the geopolitical implications of Bitcoin.The operation consisted of 2,800 computers from China, fitted into eight containers, which when linked are called a farm. It makes intense mathematical calculations, known as mining, needed to confirm Bitcoin transactions. Miners collect fees in Bitcoin for their services.Ignoring the rain, the European visitor used the calculator on his mobile phone to determine how much money could be made from this particular farm, multiplying computer power and deducting electricity and operational costs.He estimated about five Bitcoins a month, which at roughly $4,000 per Bitcoin at current price levels, would be about $20,000.Inside a Bitcoin mining operation, known as a farm. The Iranian government is beginning to explore how to use Bitcoin to evade American sanctions.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times'Not too bad,' he said.The currency fluctuates like any other, though it has proved particularly volatile, sinking to slightly less than $4,000 a unit from nearly $20,000 about a year ago.'We'll have two engineers on site to keep everything running, that's it,' said Behzad, the chief executive of IranAsic, the company running the site. He, like the European investor, did not want to provide his family name, out of fear of penalties from the United States.The Chinese computers, called Antminer V9s, were regarded as outdated by the European visitor. Still, he said, 'I guess this is the last place on earth where they are still profitable.'That helps explain why Iran seems to be taking its first baby steps toward becoming a global center for mining Bitcoins. Because of generous government subsidies, electricity â the energy for the computers needed to process cryptocurrency transactions â costs little in Iran. It goes for about six-tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour, compared with an average of 12 cents in the United States and 35 cents in Germany.In recent months, dozens of foreign investors from Europe, Russia and Asia have considered moving their mining operations to Iran and other low-cost countries like Georgia. 'We have to be flexible in this industry and go where prices are the lowest in order to survive,' said the European investor.Along on the inspection tour was a self-described ââhard-core Bitcoiner,'' Ziya Sadr, a bearded 25-year old with a beanie and a backpack full of hard drives and USB keys containing his personal stash of the currency. 'It helps me to pay to outsource jobs, or allows foreign companies to pay me,' he said.Mr. Sadr said he was currently engineering website products for foreign clients and getting paid in Bitcoin. 'These are not huge projects,' he said, 'but had it not been for Bitcoin, I wouldn't have been able get the contracts and get paid here in Iran.'Had Mr. Sadr tried any of these transactions through conventional financial institutions, his account would likely have been blocked.Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, a Bitcoin trader, at his home in Tehran. He was sanctioned by the United States Treasury and had his website blocked, but was back in business a week later with a new site.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesWhile Mr. Sadr's transactions are small, some larger companies are starting to use Bitcoin to make payments and circumvent the sanctions. Europeans and Asian counterparts are increasingly cooperative, as their governments opposed the Trump administration's decision to renounce the nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions.'There is no other way for us, Bitcoin cannot be sanctioned by anyone' said Mr. Sadr, who has discussed Bitcoin with Iranian government officials. 'Not by the U.S. government or any other government or other financial entities.'Not quite. As its recent sanctioning of two digital currency addresses, or wallets, and their two Iranian owners showed, the United States Treasury can disrupt cryptocurrency trades, even if only a minuscule fraction of the total. New anonymous wallets can be created for free within minutes.The Treasury's move came after the Justice Department had indicted two other Iranians on charges of having used ââSamsam'' ransomware in a sophisticated scheme of attacks on American hospitals, government agencies and the city of Atlanta. The two men, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, are now wanted by the F.B.I. and are thought to be hiding in Iran.During the attack on Atlanta, one of the most serious cyberattacks against a major American city, the pair broke into its computer systems and held the data hostage, eventually ransoming it for about $51,000 worth of Bitcoin. They made around $6 million in Bitcoin from the attacks, prosecutors said.When the hackers wanted to exchange their Bitcoin for Iranian rials they contacted two local traders through WhatsApp. The traders, Ali Khorashadizadeh, 29, and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, 31, exchanged some into rials.When on Nov. 28 a friend told Mr. Ghorbaniyan his name was in the news, he thought it was a mistake. He discovered that the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control had placed him and Mr. Khorashadizadeh under sanctions, as well as the Bitcoin addresses they had used. Those addresses had been linked to their websites, making their names traceable.'Please let it be known that, like every trader or bank, I have no knowledge how my clients get their money,' Mr. Ghorbaniyan said. 'I just trade. I'm not a hacker. I have nothing to do with those guys.'By the next week, however, Mr. Ghorbaniyan was back in business, using a new â this time anonymous â Bitcoin address he created in five minutes. 'Perhaps my name remains sanctioned, but we don't use names online,' he said.Mr. Ghorbaniyan said his only mistake had been making his Bitcoin address public. 'Basically, Treasury just Googled me,' he said. 'I'm not making the same mistake again.'",nytimes.com,40,world,US,en,Thomas Erdbrink,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/world/30IRAN-BITCOIN-print/00IRAN-BITCOIN05-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=0b0233e753013c15dcdd072e13e2e22c75ca975e6f7830fef36ee44ff9300b89&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,False,@nytimes,12.49178,42e2fea5484498af30a39ac9e50dd429

 Bitcoin shares with drones the unhappy distinction of being the subject of almost exclusively negative reports. Just as drones are usually doing bad things to people, so Bitcoins are usually helping people do bad things because of their supposed untraceability. So it makes a pleasant change to come across an upbeat Bitcoin story like this, as told by the Guardian: 
Kristoffer Koch invested 150 kroner ($26.60) in 5,000 bitcoins in 2009, after discovering them during the course of writing a thesis on encryption. He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency in April 2013 jogged his memory.
 In those four years, his Bitcoin holding had become worth around $886,000 â a rather nice gain on the original outlay. But the real moral here is not, as it might appear, that you should rush out and buy Bitcoins in the hope that they will be worth fabulous sums in a few years' time â the continuing fluctuations in Bitcoin's value and doubts about its underpinnings make that a very risky proposition. Rather, the key thing to note is the following: 
Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten.
 Fortunately for him, Koch did manage to remember his password. But just imagine how he would have felt if he hadn't been able to recall his private key, and had meanwhile discovered that he had $886,000 worth of Bitcoins that he couldn't access. So the real moral here is this: make sure you back up all your passwords â even the ones you think you'll never need again â just in case.

A few weeks later, Bitcoin plunged 50% from approximately $6,500 to $3,250.

Since early-December, Bitcoin has been consolidating around the key $4,000 level as die-hard fans believe that the digital currency is cheap and has found a bottom. According to my analysis, however, Bitcoin is forming another triangle pattern and is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs. Bitcoin is still in a confirmed downtrend and a breakdown from this pattern would likely foreshadow the cryptocurrency hitting the low thousands or even under $1,000, eventually.

The longer-term chart shows the now-broken descending triangle and the triangle that is currently forming. If Bitcoin breaks down from the current triangle, the downtrend will continue as the digital currency further erases its gains made during the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble.

By CCN.com: Tuesday afternoon saw Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash post minor against against the backdrop of a tepid crypto market recovery. Bitcoin SV continues to teeter on the brink of being the only major Bitcoin variant to not rank among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, closing out the period with a less than 0.5% gain.

Bitcoin Recovers from Morning Dip

Bitcoin's 24-hour trading saw almost a full 1% gain after a significant drop during the middle of the day to under $3,500. At press time the Bitcoin price stood at $3,610. Stagnation appears to be the order of the day in this bear market, with some analysts predicting a drop to under $3,000 or even further south.

The bear market may continue for several more months or even years as industry participants figure out the best use cases for cryptocurrencies. Strict payment methods like Bitcoin, which has no serious decentralization application prospects at this point, may have long-term depressions on the cards. All the same, bears and hodlers are having a great time right now with discount prices expected to continue for some time.

Technical analysts believe the Bitcoin price is at a turning point. Using the GTI VERA Bands Indicator, a new Bloomberg article suggests that the flagship cryptocurrency could be 'on the brink of a large move.' It could go either way, the indicator suggests. Bitcoin price moves over the past 18 months prove surprises could be on the cards. Crypto volatility has been decidedly lower in recent times.

bitcoin price volatility

Ikigai founder Travis Kling isn't sure what will happen. Ikagai is a 'multistrategy Cryptoasset hedge fund.' It is named after the Japanese 'reason for being.' He cautiously suggests that the bottom probably isn't in for Bitcoin. He told Bloomberg:

I am certainly willing to change my mind, but the preponderance of evidence leads us to believe that we'll see more lows before we head higher.

As CCN's in-house analyst Yashu Gola wrote:

The interim sentiment is leading bitcoin to two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, bitcoin would initially hold its gains and extend its rally to post fresher higher highs. Another one is a complete reverse, in which bitcoin would erase all its gains owing to its long-term bearish bias.

Bitcoin moves in mysterious ways. The bear market of 2014-2015 saw occasional highs followed by stark lows. Bitcoin volatility was occasionally in the 50% range. The bottom was under $100. If Bitcoin makes similar moves in the current market, the real bottom could be under $400.

Who Will Sell Before The Next Bitcoin Bull Run?

This requires, of course, a great deal of selling. Which we have seen before. However, the market is larger now than it was then. For one thing, more coins exist. For another, more investors exist. As such, drastic drops in the $,1000 range take longer to achieve. They are certainly possible. It's difficult to surprise crypto veterans.

At its heart, Bitcoin is a speculative instrument. It can function as a store of value but it will never be a stable one. Those who embrace this reality tend to weather the markets better, selling at appropriate times and pinpointing buy opportunities.

Demand for Bitcoin remains high. Crypto volatility isn't where it once was. There are even rumors that the Russian government might make a multi-billion dollar purchase in a sovereignty move. US sanctions could thus complicate the Bitcoin trading markets.

Drastic pronouncements on Bitcoin price are common and always have been. Roger Ver's $100,000 prediction of years past has still not come to fruition. More recently, Tom Lee stood by his over-bullish prediction.

It's crypto. Come for the laughs, stay for the volatility. There is a percentage of people who bought over $10,000 who have yet to sell. These people are unlikely to sell before a bull run takes it back in that direction. There is a percentage who were burned in the same moves and will never buy in again.

What is certain: 2019 is an important year for Bitcoin. It could be the year that the oldest cryptocurrency pushes closer to $1 trillion in market cap than ever before, or it could be the year that alternatives become more valuable. 'Network effects' are only metrics. They are not laws of physics. Technically speaking, Bitcoin may find itself inferior to alternative networks as they are more agile at integrating changes.

But these are all unlikely scenarios. Those who wish for some form of 'price stability' will forever be wishing for it, and the author is inclined to agree with Travis Kling: it's probably going to get worse before it gets better.
